<!-- Step 1
Begin with your standard HTML boilerplate. Add a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element, a head element, and a body element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>


<!-- Step 2
Within your head element, add a meta tag with the name set to viewport and the content set to width=device-width, initial-scale=1.

Also add a meta tag with the charset set to UTF-8. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>


<!-- Step 3
Within your head element, add a title element with the text set to Photo Gallery, and a link element to add your styles.css file to the page. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Photo Gallery</title>
    <link href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>


<!-- Step 4
Within the body element, create a div with the class set to header.
Inside the .header element nest an h1 element with the text CSS FLEXBOX PHOTO GALLERY. -->

  <body>
    <div class="header">
      <h1>CSS FLEXBOX PHOTO GALLERY</h1>
    </div>
  </body>


<!-- Step 5
Below your .header element, create a new div element with the id set to gallery.
In that #gallery element, create ten img elements. -->

  <body>
    <div class="header">
      <h1>CSS FLEXBOX PHOTO GALLERY</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="gallery">
      <img>
<!-- .................... -->
      <img>    
    </div>
  </body>


<!-- Step 6
Now you need to give each img element a src attribute. 
You are going to use the format https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/#.jpg, replacing # with the img element order.
So your first img element would use 1.jpg, your second would use 2.jpg, and so on. -->

    <div id="gallery">
      <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/1.jpg" />
 <!-- .................... -->
      <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/10.jpg" />
    </div>


<!-- Step 7
Normalize your box model by creating a * selector and setting the box-sizing property to border-box. -->

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}


<!-- Step 8
Your images are currently too large, and you will not be able to see your CSS changes.
Create a #gallery img selector to target your images. Give it a width property set to 25%.
Also set the height property to 300px to keep your images a uniform size. -->

#gallery img {
  width: 25%;
  height: 300px;
}


<!-- Step 9
Remove the margin from your body element, set the font to Arial, and give it a background color of #EBE7E7. -->

body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: Arial;
  background-color: #EBE7E7;
}

<!-- Step 10
Align your .header text in the center, give it a padding of 32px on all sides, and set the background to #E0DDDD. -->

.header {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 32px;
  background: #E0DDDD;
}


<!-- Step 11
Flexbox is a one-dimensional CSS layout approach that focuses on the flow of content. 
It offers the ability to control the way items are spaced and aligned within a container.
To set an element to use Flexbox, you give it a display property set to flex. Create a #gallery selector and give it that property. -->

#gallery {
  display: flex;
}


<!-- Step 12
Flexbox can be thought of as having two axes, the main axis and the cross axis. 
The main axis is determined by the flex-direction property. If flex-direction is set to row or row-reverse, the main axis is horizontal. 
If flex-direction is set to column or column-reverse, the main axis is vertical.
Give your #gallery selector a flex-direction property set to row. -->

#gallery {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}


<!-- Step 13
You may have noticed that your images have all moved onto the same row.

The flex-wrap property determines how your items should behave when the flex container is too small. 
Setting this property to wrap will allow your items to wrap to the next row/column (depending on your main axis), 
where nowrap will prevent your items from wrapping. When this is set to nowrap, items may either shrink to fit or overflow.

Give the #gallery selector a flex-wrap property set to wrap. You should see your images take a four-column layout. 
This is because you set their width to 25% in an earlier step. -->

#gallery {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}


<!-- Step 14
The justify-content property determines how the items inside a flex container are positioned along the main axis, affecting their position and the space around them.
Give your #gallery selector a justify-content property set to center. -->

#gallery {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: center;
}


<!-- Step 15
The align-items property positions the flex content along the cross axis. In this case, with your flex-direction set to row, your cross axis would be vertical.
To vertically center your images, give your #gallery selector an align-items property set to center. -->

#gallery {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
