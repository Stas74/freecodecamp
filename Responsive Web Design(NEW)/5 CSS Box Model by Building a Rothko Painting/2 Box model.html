<!-- Step 28
Create a new div with a class value of three right under the .two element. This will be your third rectangle. -->

<div class="three"></div>


<!-- Step 29
You don't always have to use pixels when sizing an element.
Create a new rule, .three, and set its width to 91%. -->

.three {
  width: 91%;
}


<!-- Step 30
Set the height of .three to 28%. -->

height: 28%;


<!-- Step 31
Change the background-color of .three to #b20403. -->

background-color: #b20403;


<!-- Step 32
Center the .three element on the canvas by setting its margin to auto. -->

margin: auto;


<!-- Step 33
It's helpful to have your margins push in one direction.
In this case, the bottom margin of the .one element pushes .two down 20 pixels.

In the .two selector, use margin shorthand property to set top margin to 0, horizontal margin to auto, and bottom margin to 20px. 
This will remove its top margin, horizontally center it, and set its bottom margin to 20 pixels. -->

  margin: 0 auto 20px;


<!-- Step 34
The colors and shapes of your painting are too sharp to pass as a Rothko.
Use the filter property to blur the painting by 2px in the .canvas element. -->

filter: blur(2px);


<!-- Step 35
Create a rule that targets both .one and .two and increase their blur effect by 1 pixel. -->

.one, .two {
  filter: blur(1px);
}


<!-- Step 36
Increase the blur of .three by 2 pixels. -->

filter: blur(2px);
