<!-- Step 1
By now, you should be familiar with the basic elements an HTML page should have.

Set up your code with a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element, a head element, and a body element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>


<!-- Step 2
Within the head element, add a meta tag which sets the charset to UTF-8, and a title element with the value Rothko Painting.

Within the body element, add an img element with a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png. -->

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"></meta>
    <title>Rothko Painting</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png">
  </body>
