<!-- Step 1
By now, you should be familiar with the basic elements an HTML page should have.

Set up your code with a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element, a head element, and a body element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>


<!-- Step 2
Within the head element, add a meta tag which sets the charset to UTF-8, and a title element with the value Rothko Painting.

Within the body element, add an img element with a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png. -->

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"></meta>
    <title>Rothko Painting</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png">
  </body>


<!-- Step 3
In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.

Imagine you receive a box from your favorite online retailer -- the content is the item in the box, or in our case, a header, paragraph, or image element.

Change the src attribute in the <img> from https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png 
to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-2.png. -->

    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-2.png">


<!-- Step 4
The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.

Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in.

Change the src attribute to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-3.png -->

    <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-3.png">


<!-- Step 5
Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements.
Here the bottom element has a larger top margin, pushing it further down the page.

Now that you understand the CSS box model, let's get started on the Rothko painting.
Remove the <img> element. -->


<!-- Step 6
Add a div element in the body.
Set the class attribute equal to canvas. For example, <div class="my-div">.
This will act as the canvas for your painting. -->

    <div class="canvas"></div>


<!-- Step 7
Before you can start styling the div you added, you need to link your CSS to your HTML.
Add a link element to link your styles.css file. Set the href to ./styles.css, and remember to set the rel attribute to stylesheet. -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">


<!-- Step 8
Time for CSS.
Even though your <div> has no text, it's still treated as a box with content. Write a CSS rule that uses 
the .canvas class selector and set its width to 500 pixels. Here's a CSS rule that sets the width of the class card to 300 pixels -->

.canvas {
  width: 500px;
}


<!-- Step 9
Add the height property with the value 600px to your .canvas rule. -->

height: 600px;


<!-- Step 10
Change the background-color of the canvas to #4d0f00. -->

background-color: #4d0f00;


<!-- Step 11
Every painting needs a frame.
Wrap the .canvas element in another div. Give that div the frame class. -->

    <div class="frame">
      <div class="canvas">
      </div>
    </div>


<!-- Step 12
Write a new rule using the .frame class selector.
Use the border shorthand declaration to give the .frame element a solid, black border with a width of 50px. -->

.frame {
  border: 50px solid black;
}


<!-- Step 13
The frame is much too wide.
In .frame, set its width to 500 pixels. -->

width: 500px;


<!-- Step 14
Use padding to adjust the spacing within an element.
In .frame, use the padding shorthand property to increase the space between the .frame and .canvas elements by 50px. 
The shorthand will increase space in the top, bottom, left, and right of the element's border and canvas within. -->

padding: 50px;


<!-- Step 15
Use margins to adjust the spacing outside of an element.

Using the margin property, give the .frame element vertical margin of 20px, and horizontal margin of auto. 
This will move the frame down 20 pixels and horizontally center it on the page. -->

margin: 20px auto;


<!-- Step 16
Add a new div element inside of your .canvas element.
Give the new div the class attribute with a value of one. This will be your first rectangle. -->

<div class="one"></div>


<!-- Step 17
Write a new rule that targets .one and set its width to 425 pixels. -->

.one {
  width: 425px;
}


<!-- Step 18
Now set the height for .one to 150 pixels. -->

height: 150px;


<!-- Step 19
Set the background-color of .one to #efb762. -->

background-color: #efb762;


<!-- Step 20
Use margins to position the .one element on the canvas.
Add the shorthand margin property with a vertical margin of 20px and a horizontal margin of auto. -->

margin: 20px auto;


<!-- Step 21
Now .one is centered horizontally, but its top margin is pushing past the canvas and onto the frame's border, shifting the entire canvas down 20 pixels.
Add padding of 1px to the .canvas element to give the .one element something solid to push off of. -->

padding: 1px;


<!-- Step 22
Adding 1 pixel of padding to the top, bottom, left, and right of the canvas changed its dimensions to 502 pixels x 602 pixels.
Replace the padding property with overflow set to hidden - changing the canvas back to its original dimensions. -->

  overflow: hidden;


<!-- Step 23
Add another div with a class value of two just below your one element. This will be your second rectangle. -->

<div class="two"></div>


<!-- Step 24
Create a new CSS rule using the .two selector and set its width to 475 pixels. -->

.two {
  width: 475px;
}


<!-- Step 25
Set the height of the .two element to 200 pixels. -->

height: 200px;
