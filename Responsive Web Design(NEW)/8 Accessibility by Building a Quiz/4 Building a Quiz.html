<!-- Step 56
To align the input boxes with each other, set the display property to inline-block for all input and label elements within .info elements.
Also, align the text to the right. -->

.info label, .info input {
  display: inline-block;
  text-align: right;
}


<!-- Step 57
To neaten the .question-block elements, set the following CSS properties: -->

.question-block {
  text-align: left;
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  margin-top: 20px;
  padding-top: 5px;
}


<!-- Step 58
Make the paragraph elements appear as a higher priority, with the following CSS properties:; -->

p {
  margin-top: 5px;
  padding-left: 15px;
  font-size: 20px;
}


<!-- Step 59
It is useful to see the default border around the fieldset elements, during development. However, it might not be the style you want.
Remove the border and bottom padding on the .question elements. -->

.question {
  border: none;
  padding-bottom: 0;
}


<!-- Step 60
Remove the default styling for the list items of .answers-list, and remove the unordered list padding. -->

.answers-list {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}


<!-- Step 61
Give the submit button a freeCodeCamp-style design, with the following CSS properties: -->

button {
  display: block;
  margin: 40px auto;
  width: 40%;
  padding: 15px;
  font-size: 23px;
  background: #d0d0d5;
  border: 3px solid #3b3b4f;
}


<!-- Step 62
Set the footer background color to #2a2a40, and use Flexbox to horizontally center the text. -->

footer {
  background-color: #2a2a40;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}


<!-- Step 63
Now, we cannot read the text. Target the footer and the anchor element within to set the font color to a color of adequate contrast ratio. -->

footer, footer a {
  color: #dfdfe2;
}


<!-- Step 64
Horizontally center all the text within the address element, and add some padding. -->

address {
  display: flex;
	text-align: center;
  padding: 5px;
}


<!-- Step 65
Clicking on the navigation links should jump the viewport to the relevant section. However, this jumping can be disorienting for some users.
Select all elements, and set the scroll-behavior to smooth. -->

* {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}


<!-- Step 66
Setting the scroll-behavior to smooth is preferred by most users. 
However, some users find this to be too slow, and prefer to have the scrolling happen instantaneously.
There exists a media rule to set CSS based on the user's browser settings. This media rule is called prefers-reduced-motion, and expects one of the following values:

reduce
no-preference
Wrap the appropriate rule within a prefers-reduced-motion media rule such that a scroll-behavior of smooth 
is only set if the user's browser setting is no-preference. -->

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {  
  * {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
  }
}


<!-- Step 67
Finally, the navigation accessibility can be improved by providing keyboard shortcuts.

The accesskey attribute accepts a space-separated list of access keys. For example:

<button type="submit" accesskey="s">Submit</button>
Give each of the navigation links a single-letter access key.

Note: It is not always advised to use access keys, but they can be useful

Well done. You have completed the Accessibility Quiz practice project. -->

        <ul>
          <li><a href="#student-info" accesskey="i">INFO</a></li>
          <li><a href="#html-questions" accesskey="h">HTML</a></li>
          <li><a href="#css-questions" accesskey="c">CSS</a></li>
				</ul>
