<!-- Step 39
As with the other input and label elements, link the textarea to its corresponding label element, and give it a name attribute. -->

            <div class="question-block">
              <label for="css-questions">Do you have any questions:</label>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <textarea id="css-questions" name="css-questions" rows="5" cols="24" placeholder="Who is flexbox..."></textarea>
            </div>
          </div>


<!-- Step 40
Do not forget to give your form a submit button. -->

<button type="submit">Submit</button>


<!-- Step 41
Two final semantic HTML elements for this project are the footer and address elements. 
The footer element is a container for a collection of content that is related to the page, 
and the address element is a container for contact information for the author of the page.
After the main element, add one footer element, and nest one address element within it. -->

<footer>
  <address></address>
</footer>


<!-- Step 42
Within the address element, add the following:

freeCodeCamp<br />
San Francisco<br />
California<br />
USA
You can visit, but you might not find anything... -->

    <footer>
      <address>
        freeCodeCamp<br />
        San Francisco<br />
        California<br />
        USA
      </address>
    </footer>


<!-- Step 43
The address element does not have to contain a physical geographical location. It can be used to provide a link to the subject.
Wrap a link around the text freeCodeCamp, and set its location to https://freecodecamp.org. -->

    <footer>
      <address>
        <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a><br />
        San Francisco<br />
        California<br />
        USA
      </address>
    </footer>


<!-- Step 44
Back to styling the page. Select the list elements within the navigation bar, and give them the following styles:

color: #dfdfe2;
margin: 0 0.2rem;
padding: 0.2rem;
display: block; -->

nav li {
/* nav > ul > li */
	color: #dfdfe2;
	margin: 0 0.2rem;
	padding: 0.2rem;
	display: block;
}


<!-- Step 45
On the topic of visual accessibility, contrast between elements is a key factor. 
For example, the contrast between the text and the background of a heading should be at least 4.5:1.
Change the font color of all the anchor elements within the list elements to something with a contrast ratio of at least 7:1. -->

li > a {
	color: #dfdfe2; 
}
