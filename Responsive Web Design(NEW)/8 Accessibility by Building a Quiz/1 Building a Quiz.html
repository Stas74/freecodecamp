<!-- Step 1
Welcome to the first part of the Accessibility Quiz. As you are becoming a seasoned HTML and CSS developer, we have started you off with the basic boilerplate.

Start this accessibility journey by providing a lang attribute to your html element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="eng">
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>


<!-- Step 2
You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.
Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset value.
The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers. -->

  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
  </head>


<!-- Step 3
Continuing with the meta elements, a viewport definition tells the browser how to render the page. 
Including one betters visual accessibility on mobile, and improves SEO (search engine optimization).
Add a viewport definition with a content attribute detailing the width and initial-scale of the page. -->

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport"content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>


<!-- Step 4
Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition. 
The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.
Add a meta element with the name attribute set to description, and give it a useful content attribute. -->

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name="description" content="quiz page" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>


<!-- Step 5
Lastly in the head, the title element is useful for screen readers to understand the content of a page. Furthermore, it is an important part of SEO.
Give your page a title that is descriptive and concise. -->

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name="description" content="freeCodeCamp Accessibility Quiz practice project" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <title>Accessibility Quiz practice project</title>
  </head>
