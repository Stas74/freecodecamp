<!-- Step 35
Now that you've gone through all the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors on a color wheel, 
it'll be easier to understand other color theory concepts and how they impact design.
First, in the rules .one, .two, and .three, adjust the values in the rgb function so that the background-color of each element is set to pure black. 
Remember that the rgb function uses the additive color model, where colors start as black and change as the values of red, green, and blue increase. -->

.one {
  background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}

.two {
  background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}

.three {
  background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}


<!-- Step 36
A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. 
For example, pure red is between the hues rose and orange.

Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. 
If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray. But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter.

In the rgb function for the .one CSS rule, set the red value to the max of 255 to produce pure red. 
In the rgb function for .two CSS rule, set the values for green and blue to the max of 255 to produce cyan. -->

.one {
  background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
}

.two {
  background-color: rgb(0, 255, 255);
}


<!-- Step 37
Notice that the red and cyan colors are very bright right next to each other. 
This contrast can be distracting if it's overused on a website, and can make text hard to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background.

It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.

First, in the h1 rule, use the rgb function to set its background color to cyan. -->

h1 {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: rgb(0, 255, 255);
}


<!-- Step 38
Next, in the .one rule, use the rgb function to set the background-color to black. And in the .two rule, use the rgb function to set the background-color to red. -->

.one {
  background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}

.two {
  background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
}


<!-- Step 39
Notice how your eyes are naturally drawn to the red color in the center? 
When designing a site, you can use this effect to draw attention to important headings, buttons, or links.

There are several other important color combinations outside of complementary colors, but you'll learn those a bit later.

For now, use the rgb function in the .two rule to set the background-color to black. -->

.two {
  background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}


<!-- Step 40
And in the h1 rule, remove the background-color property and value to go back to the default white color. -->

h1 {
  text-align: center; 
}


<!-- Step 41
Now it's time to add other details to the markers, starting with the first one.

In the first marker div element, change the class one to red. -->

      <div class="marker red">
      </div>


<!-- Step 42
Update the .one class selector to target the new red class. -->

.red {
  background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}


<!-- Step 43
And update the rgb function in the .red rule so that the red value is at the max. -->

.red {
  background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
}


<!-- Step 44
Next, change the class two to green in the second marker div, and the class three to blue in the third marker div. -->

      <div class="marker green">
      </div>
      <div class="marker blue">
      </div>


<!-- Step 45
Update the CSS class selector .two so it targets the new green class. And update the .three selector so it targets the new blue class. -->

.green {
  background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}
.blue {
  background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}


<!-- Step 46
A very common way to apply color to an element with CSS is with hexadecimal or hex values. 
While hex values sound complicated, they're really just another form of RGB values.

Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. 
The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. For example, #4B5320.

In the .green CSS rule, set the background-color property to a hex color code with the values 00 for red, FF for green, and 00 blue. -->

.green {
  background-color: #00FF00;
}


<!-- Step 47
You may already be familiar with decimal, or base 10 values, which go from 0 - 9. Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).

Lower the intensity of green by setting green value of the hex color to 7F. -->

.green {
  background-color: #007F00;
}


<!-- Step 48
The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.

The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.

Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.

In the .blue CSS rule, use the hsl function to change the background-color property to pure blue. 
Set the hue to 240, the saturation to 100%, and the lightness to 50%. -->

.blue {
  background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);
}


<!-- Step 49
You've learned a few ways to set flat colors in CSS, but you can also use a color transition, or gradient, on an element.

A gradient is when one color transitions into another. 
The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, 
and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.

In the .red CSS rule, change the background-color property to background. -->

.red {
  background: rgb(255, 0, 0);
}


<!-- Step 50
The linear-gradient function is very flexible -- here is the basic syntax you'll use in this tutorial:

linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);
gradientDirection is the direction of the line used for the transition. 
color1 and color2 are color arguments, which are the colors that will be used in the transition itself. 
These can be any type of color, including color keywords, hex, rgb, or hsl.

Now you'll apply a red-to-green gradient along a 90 degree line to the first marker.

First, in the .red CSS rule, set the background property to linear-gradient(), and pass it the value 90deg as the gradientDirection. -->

.red {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg);
}


<!-- Step 51
You'll use the rgb function for the colors of this gradient.

In the linear-gradient function, use the rgb function to set the first color argument to pure red. -->

.red {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(255, 0, 0));
}


<!-- Step 52
You won't see gradient yet because the linear-gradient function needs at least two color arguments to work.

In the same linear-gradient function, use the rgb function to set the second color argument to pure green. -->

.red {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(255, 0, 0), rgb(0, 255, 0));
}


<!-- Step 53
As you can see, the linear-gradient function produced a smooth red-green gradient. 
While the linear-gradient function needs a minimum of two color arguments to work, it can accept many color arguments.

Use the rgb function to add pure blue as the third color argument to the linear-gradient function. -->

.red {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(255, 0, 0), rgb(0, 255, 0), rgb(0, 0, 255));
}


<!-- Step 54
Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. 
They are a length unit like px or percentages that follow a color in the linear-gradient function.

For example, in this red-black gradient, the transition from red to black takes place at the 90% point along the gradient line, 
so red takes up most of the available space:

linear-gradient(90deg, red 90%, black);
In the linear-gradient function, add a 75% color stop after the first red color argument. Do not add color stops to the other colors arguments. -->

.red {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(255, 0, 0) 75%, rgb(0, 255, 0), rgb(0, 0, 255));
}


<!-- Step 55
Now that you know the basics of how the linear-gradient function and color-stops work, you can use them to make the markers look more realistic.

In the linear-gradient function, set gradientDirection to 180deg. -->

.red {
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgb(255, 0, 0) 75%, rgb(0, 255, 0), rgb(0, 0, 255));
}
