<!-- Step 66
Now you'll apply a gradient to the blue marker, this time using the hsl function as color arguments.
In the .blue CSS rule, change the background-color property to background. -->

.blue {
  background: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);
}


<!-- Step 67
Use the linear-gradient function, and pass in the hsl function with the values 186 for hue, 76% for saturation, and 16% for lightness as the first color argument. -->

.blue {
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(186, 76%, 16%));
}


<!-- Step 68
As the second color argument, pass in the hsl function with the values 223 for hue, 90% for saturation, and 60% for lightness. -->

.blue {
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(186, 76%, 16%), hsl(223, 90%, 60%));
}


<!-- Step 69
And as the third color argument, pass in the hsl function with the values 240 for hue, 56% for saturation, and 42% for lightness. -->

.blue {
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(186, 76%, 16%), hsl(223, 90%, 60%), hsl(240, 56%, 42%));
}


<!-- Step 70
Now that the markers have the correct colors, it's time to build the marker sleeves. Start with the red marker.

Inside the red marker div, create a new div and give it a class of sleeve. -->

      <div class="marker red">
        <div class="sleeve">
        </div>
      </div>
