<!-- Step 66
Now you'll apply a gradient to the blue marker, this time using the hsl function as color arguments.
In the .blue CSS rule, change the background-color property to background. -->

.blue {
  background: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);
}


<!-- Step 67
Use the linear-gradient function, and pass in the hsl function with the values 186 for hue, 76% for saturation, and 16% for lightness as the first color argument. -->

.blue {
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(186, 76%, 16%));
}


<!-- Step 68
As the second color argument, pass in the hsl function with the values 223 for hue, 90% for saturation, and 60% for lightness. -->

.blue {
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(186, 76%, 16%), hsl(223, 90%, 60%));
}


<!-- Step 69
And as the third color argument, pass in the hsl function with the values 240 for hue, 56% for saturation, and 42% for lightness. -->

.blue {
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(186, 76%, 16%), hsl(223, 90%, 60%), hsl(240, 56%, 42%));
}


<!-- Step 70
Now that the markers have the correct colors, it's time to build the marker sleeves. Start with the red marker.

Inside the red marker div, create a new div and give it a class of sleeve. -->

      <div class="marker red">
        <div class="sleeve">
        </div>
      </div>


<!-- Step 71
Create a new CSS rule that targets the class sleeve. Set the width property to 110px, and the height property to 25px. -->

.sleeve {
  width: 110px;
  height: 25px;
}


<!-- Step 72
To make the marker look more realistic, give the sleeve a transparent white color.

First, set the sleeve element's background-color to white. -->

.sleeve {
  width: 110px;
  height: 25px;
  background-color: white;
}


<!-- Step 73
Opacity describes how opaque, or non-transparent, something is. For example, a solid wall is opaque, and no light can pass through. 
But a drinking glass is much more transparent, and you can see through the glass to the other side.

With the CSS opacity property, you can control how opaque or transparent an element is. 
With the value 0, or 0%, the element will be completely transparent, and at 1.0, or 100%, the element will be completely opaque like it is by default.

In the .sleeve CSS rule, set the opacity property to 0.5. -->

.sleeve {
  width: 110px;
  height: 25px;
  background-color: white;
  opacity: 0.5;
}


<!-- Step 74
Another way to set the opacity for an element is with the alpha channel. 
Similar to the opacity property, the alpha channel controls how transparent or opaque a color is.

You've already set sleeve's opacity with a named color and the opacity property, but you can add an alpha channel to the other CSS color properties.

Inside the .sleeve rule, remove the opacity property and value. -->

.sleeve {
  width: 110px;
  height: 25px;
  background-color: white;
}


<!-- Step 75
You're already familiar with using the rgb function to set colors. To add an alpha channel to an rgb color, use the rgba function instead.

The rgba function works just like the rgb function, but takes one more number from 0 to 1.0 for the alpha channel:

rgba(redValue, greenValue, blueValue, alphaValue);
In the .sleeve rule, use the rgba function to set the background-color property to pure white with 50% opacity. -->

.sleeve {
  width: 110px;
  height: 25px;
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
}


<!-- Step 76
Your sleeve is looking good, but it would look even better if it was positioned more toward the right side of the marker. 
One way to do that is to add another element before the sleeve to push it to the right.

Add a new div with the class cap before the sleeve div element. -->

      <div class="marker red">
        <div class="cap"></div>
        <div class="sleeve"></div>
      </div>


<!-- Step 77
Create a new CSS rule to target the class cap. In the new rule, set the width property to 60px, and the height to 25px. -->

.cap {
  width: 60px;
  height: 25px;
}


<!-- Step 78
It looks like your sleeve disappeared, but don't worry -- it's still there. 
What happened is that your new cap div is taking up the entire width of the marker, and is pushing the sleeve down to the next line.

This is because the default display property for div elements is block. 
So when two block elements are next to each other, they stack like actual blocks. For example, your marker elements are all stacked on top of each other.

To position two div elements on the same line, set their display properties to inline-block.

Create a new rule to target both the cap and sleeve classes, and set display to inline-block. -->

.cap, .sleeve {
  display: inline-block;
}


<!-- Step 79
In the last project, you learned a little bit about borders and the border-color property.

All HTML elements have borders, though they're usually set to none by default. With CSS, you can control all aspects of an element's border, and set the border on all sides, or just one side at a time. For a border to be visible, you need to set its width and style.

In the .sleeve CSS rule, add the border-left-width property with the value 10px. -->

.sleeve {
  width: 110px;
  height: 25px;
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
  border-left-width: 10px;
}


<!-- Step 80
Borders have several styles to choose from. You can make your border a solid line, but you can also use a dashed or dotted line if you prefer. 
Solid border lines are probably the most common.

In the .sleeve CSS rule, add the border-left-style property with the value solid. -->

.sleeve {
  width: 110px;
  height: 25px;
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
  border-left-width: 10px;
  border-left-style: solid;
}
