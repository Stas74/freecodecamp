<!-- Step 37
The HTML for the registration form is finished. Now, you can spruce it up a bit.

Start by changing the font to Tahoma, and the font size to 16px in the body. -->

body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  background-color: #1b1b32;
	color: #f5f6f7;
  font-family: Tahoma;
  font-size: 16px;
}


<!-- Step 38
Center the h1 and p elements by giving them a margin of 1em auto. Then, center align the text as well. -->

h1, p {
  margin: 1em auto;
  text-align: center;
}


<!-- Step 39
Center the form element, by giving it a margin of 0 auto. 
Then, fix its size to a maximum width of 500px, and a minimum width of 300px. In between that range, allow it to have a width of 60vw. -->

form {
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 500px;
  min-width: 300px;
  width: 60vw;
}


<!-- Step 40
During development, it is useful to see the fieldset default borders. However, they make the content appear too separated.

Remove the border, and add 2rem of padding only to the top and bottom of each fieldset. Be sure to remove the padding from the left and right. -->

fieldset {
  border: 0;
  padding: 2rem 0;
}


<!-- Step 41
To give the fieldset elements a bit of separation, select all but the last fieldset element, and give them a border-bottom of 3px solid #3b3b4f. -->

fieldset:not(:last-of-type) {
  border-bottom: 3px solid #3b3b4f;
}


<!-- Step 42
It would be nicer to have the label text appear above the form elements.

Select all input, textarea, and select elements, and make them take up the full width of their parent elements.

Also, add 10px of margin to the top of the selected elements. Set the other margins to 0. -->

input, textarea, select {
  width: 100%;
  margin: 10px 0 0 0;
}
