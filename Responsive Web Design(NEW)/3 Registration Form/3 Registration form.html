<!-- Step 37
The HTML for the registration form is finished. Now, you can spruce it up a bit.

Start by changing the font to Tahoma, and the font size to 16px in the body. -->

body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  background-color: #1b1b32;
	color: #f5f6f7;
  font-family: Tahoma;
  font-size: 16px;
}


<!-- Step 38
Center the h1 and p elements by giving them a margin of 1em auto. Then, center align the text as well. -->

h1, p {
  margin: 1em auto;
  text-align: center;
}


<!-- Step 39
Center the form element, by giving it a margin of 0 auto. 
Then, fix its size to a maximum width of 500px, and a minimum width of 300px. In between that range, allow it to have a width of 60vw. -->

form {
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 500px;
  min-width: 300px;
  width: 60vw;
}
