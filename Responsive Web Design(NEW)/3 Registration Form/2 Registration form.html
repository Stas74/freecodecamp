<!-- Step 26
To finish this fieldset off, link the text terms and conditions to the following location:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/ -->

      <fieldset>
        <label><input type="radio" name="account-type" /> Personal Account</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="account-type" /> Business Account</label>
        <label><input type="checkbox" required /> I accept the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/">terms and conditions</a></label>
      </fieldset>


<!-- Step 27
Moving on to the final fieldset. What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?

Well, the input type file allows just that. Add a label with the text Upload a profile picture: , and add an input accepting a file upload. -->

      <fieldset>
        <label>Upload a profile picture: <input type="file" /></label>
      </fieldset>


<!-- Step 28
Add another label after the first, with the text Input your age (years): . Then, nest an input with the type of number.

As we do not want users under the age of 13 to register, add a min attribute to the input with a value of 13. 
Also, we can probably assume users over the age of 120 will not register; add a max attribute with a value of 120.

Now, if someone tries to submit the form with values outside of the range, a warning will appear, and the form will not submit. Give it a try. -->

      <fieldset>
        <label>Upload a profile picture: <input type="file" /></label>
        <label>Input your age (years): <input type="number" min="13" max="120"></label>        
      </fieldset>


<!-- Step 29
Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. 
The select element is a container for a group of option elements, and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags.

Start, by adding a select element below the two label elements. Then, nest 5 option elements within the select element. -->

      <fieldset>
        <label>Upload a profile picture: <input type="file" /></label>
        <label>Input your age (years): <input type="number" min="13" max="120" />
			  </label>
        <select>
          <option>
          </option>
<!--           ..............         -->
        </select>
      </fieldset>


<!-- Step 30
Nest the select element within a label element with the text How did you hear about us?. The text should come before the select element. -->

      <fieldset>
        <label>Upload a profile picture: <input type="file" /></label>
        <label>Input your age (years): <input type="number" min="13" max="120" /></label>
        <label>How did you hear about us?          
          <select>
            <option></option>
<!--                 ............ -->
          </select>
        </label>
      </fieldset>
