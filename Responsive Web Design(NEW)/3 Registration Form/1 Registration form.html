<!-- Step 1
Welcome to the Registration Form project! 
Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>


<!-- Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>


<!-- Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>


<!-- Step 4
Add a title element to the head, and give your project a title of Registration Form. Also, nest a self-closing link element in the head element. 
Give it a rel attribute value of stylesheet, a type attribute value of text/css, and an href attribute value of styles.css. -->

  <head>
    <title>Registration Form</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"/>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>


<!-- Step 5
Within the body, provide a heading context for the content, by adding an h1 with the text Registration Form. -->

  <body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
  </body>
