<!-- Step 1
Welcome to the Registration Form project! 
Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>


<!-- Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>


<!-- Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>


<!-- Step 4
Add a title element to the head, and give your project a title of Registration Form. Also, nest a self-closing link element in the head element. 
Give it a rel attribute value of stylesheet, a type attribute value of text/css, and an href attribute value of styles.css. -->

  <head>
    <title>Registration Form</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"/>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>


<!-- Step 5
Within the body, provide a heading context for the content, by adding an h1 with the text Registration Form. -->

  <body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
  </body>

<!-- Step 6
Below the heading, use the following text within a paragraph element to encourage users to register:

Please fill out this form with the required information -->

  <body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
  </body>


<!-- Step 7
To spruce the project up, let us add some CSS. Begin by giving the body a width of 100%, and a height of 100vh. -->

body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
}


<!-- Step 8
Now, get rid of the horizontal scroll-bar, by setting the body default margin added by some browsers to 0. -->

body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
}


<!-- Step 9
That is better. Now, make the background easy on the eyes, by changing the body background-color to #1b1b32. Then, to see the text, change the color to #f5f6f7. -->

body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  background-color: #1b1b32;
  color: #f5f6f7;
}


<!-- Step 10
As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. 
So, after the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org. -->

  <body>
    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
    <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org">
  </body>
