<!-- Step 1
Start by setting up your HTML structure. Add a <!DOCTYPE> declaration and an html element. Within the html element, add a head element and a body element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>


<!-- Step 2
Within your head element, add a meta tag with the charset attribute set to utf-8. Also add a title element with the text Picasso Painting. -->

<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Picasso Painting</title>


<!-- Step 3
Go ahead and link your CSS file now, even though you have not written any CSS yet.
Add a link element with a rel of stylesheet, a type of text/css, and an href of styles.css. -->

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />


<!-- Step 4
FontAwesome is a library of SVG-powered icons, many of which are freely available to use. 
You will be using some of these icons in this project, so you will need to link the external stylesheet to your HTML.
Add a link element with a rel of stylesheet and an href of https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css. -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css" />


<!-- Step 5
To get your painting started, give your body element a background-color of rgb(184, 132, 46). -->

body {
  background-color: rgb(184, 132, 46);
}


<!-- Step 6
Within your body tag, add a div element. Give it an id of back-wall. -->

<div id="back-wall"></div>


<!-- Step 7
Use an id selector to give the back-wall element a background-color of #8B4513. -->

#back-wall {
  background-color: #8B4513;
}


<!-- Step 8
Give the back-wall element a width of 100% and a height of 60%. -->

width: 100%;
height: 60%;


<!-- Step 9
Typically, HTML is rendered in a top-down manner. Elements at the top of the code are positioned at the top of the page. 
However, many times you may want to move the elements to different positions. You can do this with the position attribute.

Set the position attribute for the back-wall element to absolute. 
An absolute position takes the element out of that top-down document flow and allows you to adjust it relative to its container.

When an element is manually positioned, you can shift its layout with top, left, right, and bottom. 
Set the back-wall to have a top value of 0, and a left value of 0. -->

position: absolute;
top: 0;
left: 0;


<!-- Step 10
The z-index property is used to create "layers" for your HTML elements. If you are familiar with image editing tools, you may have worked with layers before. 
This is a similar concept.

Elements with a higher z-index value will appear to be layered on top of elements with a lower z-index value. 
This can be combined with the positioning in the previous lesson to create unique effects.

Since the back-wall element will need to appear "behind" the other elements you will be creating, give the back-wall element a z-index of -1. -->

z-index: -1;


<!-- Step 11
Below your back-wall element, create a div with a class of characters. This is where you will be creating your painting's characters. -->

<div class="characters"></div>


<!-- Step 12
Inside that characters element, create another div with an id of offwhite-character. -->

<div id="offwhite-character"></div>


<!-- Step 13
Create four div elements inside your offwhite-character element. Give those div elements the following id values, in order: 
white-hat, black-mask, gray-instrument, tan-table. -->

<div id="white-hat"></div>
<div id="black-mask"></div>
<div id="gray-instrument"></div>
<div id="tan-table"></div>


<!-- Step 14
This character needs eyes. Create two div elements in the black-mask element. Give them the classes eyes left and eyes right, in that order. -->

<div class="eyes left"></div>
<div class="eyes right"></div>


Step 15
<!-- Create some "dots" for the instrument. Add five div elements within your gray-instrument element. Set the class of each to black-dot. -->

<div class="black-dot"></div>
<div class="black-dot"></div>
<div class="black-dot"></div>
<div class="black-dot"></div>
<div class="black-dot"></div>
