<!-- Step 18
Now it is time to use the pseudo-selectors you prepared for earlier. To create the black keys, add a new .key.black--key::after selector. 
This will target the elements with the class key black--key, and select the pseudo-element after these elements in the HTML.

In the new selector, set the background-color to #1d1e22. Also set the content property to "". This will make the pseudo-elements empty.

The content property is used to set or override the content of the element. 
By default, the pseudo-elements created by the ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors are empty, and the elements will not be rendered to the page. 
Setting the content property to an empty string "" will ensure the element is rendered to the page while still being empty.

If you would like to experiment, try removing the background-color property and setting different values for the content property, such as "â™¥". 
Remember to undo these changes when you are done so the tests pass. -->

.key.black--key::after {
  background-color: #1d1e22;
  content: "";
}


<!-- Step 19
Give the .key.black--key::after a position property set to absolute and a left property set to -18px. -->

.key.black--key::after {
  background-color: #1d1e22;
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  left: -18px;
}


<!-- Step 20
For the .key.black--key::after, set the width to 32px and the height to 100px. -->

.key.black--key::after {
  background-color: #1d1e22;
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  left: -18px;
  width: 32px;
  height: 100px;
}
