<!-- Step 36
Squeeze the buildings together again by adding two empty div elements within both the top and bottom of the .foreground-buildings element, 
and one more in between .fb2 and .fb3. -->

    <div class="foreground-buildings">
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
      <div class="fb1"></div>
      <div class="fb2"></div>
      <div></div>
      <div class="fb3"></div>
      <div class="fb4"></div>
      <div class="fb5"></div>
      <div class="fb6"></div>
      <div></div>
      <div></div>
    </div>


<!-- Step 37
Move the position of .fb4 relative to where it is now by adding a position of relative and left of 10% to it. Do the same for .fb5 but use right instead of left. 
This will cover up the remaining white space in between the buildings. -->

.fb4 {
  width: 8%;
  height: 45%;
  background-color: var(--building-color1);
  position: relative;
  left: 10%;
}

.fb5 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 33%;
  background-color: var(--building-color2);
  position: relative;
  right: 10%;
}


<!-- Step 38
Your code is starting to get quite long. Add a comment above the .fb1 class that says FOREGROUND BUILDINGS - "fb" stands for "foreground building" 
to help people understand your code. Above the .bb1 class add another comment that says BACKGROUND BUILDINGS - "bb" stands for "background building". 
If you don't remember, comments in CSS look like this: /* Comment here */. -->

/* BACKGROUND BUILDINGS - "bb" stands for "background building" */

/* FOREGROUND BUILDINGS - "fb" stands for "foreground building" */


<!-- Step 39
Create a new variable in :root called --window-color1 and give it a value of black. This will be a secondary color for the purple buildings. -->

:root {
  --building-color1: #aa80ff;
  --building-color2: #66cc99;
  --building-color3: #cc6699;
  --building-color4: #538cc6;
  --window-color1: black;
}


<!-- Step 40
Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element. They are applied to the background property and the syntax looks like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2
);
In the example, color1 is solid at the top, color2 is solid at the bottom, and in between it transitions evenly from one to the next. 
In .bb1a, add a gradient of type linear-gradient to the background property with --building-color1 as the first color and --window-color1 as the second. -->

.bb1a {
  width: 70%;
  height: 10%;
  background: linear-gradient(var(--building-color1), var(--window-color1));
}
