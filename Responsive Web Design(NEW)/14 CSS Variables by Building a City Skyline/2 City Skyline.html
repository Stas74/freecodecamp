<!-- Step 24
Create a new variable below the other ones named --building-color3 and give it a value of #cc6699. 
Then use it as the background-color of the .bb3 class and give it a fallback value of pink. -->

.bb1 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 70%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  --building-color1: #aa80ff;
  --building-color2: #66cc99;
  --building-color3: #cc6699;
}

.bb3 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 55%;
  background-color: var(--building-color3, pink);
}


<!-- Step 25
That one used the fallback value as well? I see the problem now! The variables you declared in .bb1 do not cascade to the .bb2 and .bb3 sibling elements. 
That's just how CSS works. Because of this, variables are often declared in the :root selector. This is the highest level selector in CSS; putting your variables 
there will make them usable everywhere. Add the :root selector to the top of your stylesheet, and move all your variable declarations there. -->

:root {
  --building-color1: #aa80ff;
  --building-color2: #66cc99;
  --building-color3: #cc6699;
}


<!-- Step 26
Now that you've worked the bugs out and the buildings are the right colors, you can remove the fallback values in the two places they were used. 
Go ahead and do that now. -->

.bb2 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 50%;
  background-color: var(--building-color2);
}

.bb3 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 55%;
  background-color: var(--building-color3);
}


<!-- Step 27
Create another variable named --building-color4 and give it a value of #538cc6. Make sure it's in the :root selector this time. 
Then use it to fill in the last building. -->

:root {
  --building-color1: #aa80ff;
  --building-color2: #66cc99;
  --building-color3: #cc6699;
  --building-color4: #538cc6;
}

.bb4 {
  width: 11%;
  height: 58%;
  background-color: var(--building-color4);
}


<!-- Step 28
The background buildings are starting to look pretty good. Create a new div below the background-buildings element and give it a class of foreground-buildings. 
This will be another container for more buildings. -->

<div class="foreground-buildings"></div>


<!-- Step 29
You want the foreground buildings container to sit directly on top of the background buildings element. Give it a width and height of 100%, 
set the position to absolute, and the top to 0. This will make it the same size as the body and move the start of it to the top left corner. -->

.foreground-buildings {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
}


<!-- Step 30
Nest six div elements within .foreground-buildings and give them the classes of fb1 through fb6 in that order. "fb" stands for "foreground building". 
These will be six more buildings for the foreground. -->

    <div class="foreground-buildings">
      <div class="fb1"></div>
      <div class="fb2"></div>
      <div class="fb3"></div>
      <div class="fb4"></div>
      <div class="fb5"></div>
      <div class="fb6"></div>
    </div>
