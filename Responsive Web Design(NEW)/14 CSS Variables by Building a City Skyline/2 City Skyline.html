<!-- Step 24
Create a new variable below the other ones named --building-color3 and give it a value of #cc6699. 
Then use it as the background-color of the .bb3 class and give it a fallback value of pink. -->

.bb1 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 70%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  --building-color1: #aa80ff;
  --building-color2: #66cc99;
  --building-color3: #cc6699;
}

.bb3 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 55%;
  background-color: var(--building-color3, pink);
}


<!-- Step 25
That one used the fallback value as well? I see the problem now! The variables you declared in .bb1 do not cascade to the .bb2 and .bb3 sibling elements. 
That's just how CSS works. Because of this, variables are often declared in the :root selector. This is the highest level selector in CSS; putting your variables 
there will make them usable everywhere. Add the :root selector to the top of your stylesheet, and move all your variable declarations there. -->

:root {
  --building-color1: #aa80ff;
  --building-color2: #66cc99;
  --building-color3: #cc6699;
}
