<!-- Step 59
On to the next building! 
Create a new variable called --window-color3 in :root and give it a value of #d98cb3. This will be the secondary color for the pink buildings. -->

:root {
  --building-color1: #aa80ff;
  --building-color2: #66cc99;
  --building-color3: #cc6699;
  --building-color4: #538cc6;
  --window-color1: black;
  --window-color2: #8cd9b3;
  --window-color3: #d98cb3;
}


<!-- Step 60
So far, all the gradients you created have gone from top to bottom, that's the default direction. 
You can specify another direction by adding it before your colors like this:

gradient-type(
  direction,
  color1,
  color2
);
Fill in .bb3 with a repeating-linear-gradient. Use 90deg for the direction, your building-color3 for the first two colors, and window-color3 at 15% for the third. 
When you don't specify a distance for a color, it will use the values that makes sense. 
In this case, the first two colors will default to 0% and 7.5% because it starts at 0%, and 7.5% is half of the 15%. -->

.bb3 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 55%;
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    var(--building-color3),
    var(--building-color3),
    var(--window-color3) 15%
  );
}
