<!-- Step 1
Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document 
so the browser knows what type of document it's reading. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>


<!-- Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. -->

<html></html>


<!-- Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element. -->

<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>


<!-- Step 4
Add a title element to the head, and give your project a title of City Skyline. Also, nest a self-closing link element in the head element. 
Give it a rel attribute value of stylesheet, a type attribute value of text/css, and an href attribute value of styles.css. -->

  <head>
    <title>City Skyline</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
  </head>


<!-- Step 5
In CSS, you can target everything with an asterisk. Add a border to everything by using the * selector, and giving it a border of 1px solid black. 
This is a trick I like to use to help visualize where elements are and their size. You will remove this later. -->

* {
  border: 1px solid black;
}


<!-- Step 6
Also add a box-sizing of border-box to everything. This will make it so the border you added doesn't add any size to your elements. -->

* {
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}


<!-- Step 7
You can see the body (it's the inner-most box on your page); the box around it is the html element. 
Make your body fill the whole viewport by giving it a height of 100vh. Remove the default margin from the body by setting the margin to 0. 
Finally, set the overflow property to hidden to hide any scroll bars that appear when something extends past the viewport. -->

body {
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}


<!-- Step 8
Create a div element in the body with a class of background-buildings. This will be a container for a group of buildings. -->

  <body>
    <div class="background-buildings"></div>
  </body>


<!-- Step 9
Give your background buildings element a width and height of 100% to make it the full width and height of its parent, the body. -->

.background-buildings {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}


<!-- Step 10
Nest a div with a class of bb1 in the background buildings container. Open your styles.css file, and give .bb1 a width of 10% and height of 70%. 
"bb" stands for "background building", this will be your first building. -->

    <div class="background-buildings">
      <div class="bb1"></div>
    </div>

.bb1 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 70%;
}  


<!-- Step 11
Nest four div elements in the .bb1 container. Give them the classes bb1a, bb1b, bb1c, and bb1d in that order. This building will have four sections. -->

      <div class="bb1">
        <div class="bb1a"></div>
        <div class="bb1b"></div>
        <div class="bb1c"></div>
        <div class="bb1d"></div>
      </div>


<!-- Step 12
Give the parts of your building width and height properties with these values: 70% and 10% to .bb1a, 80% and 10% to .bb1b, 90% and 10% to .bb1c, 
and 100% and 70% to .bb1d. 
Remember that these percentages are relative to the parent and note that the heights will add up to 100% - vertically filling the container. -->

.bb1a {
  width: 70%;
  height: 10%;
}

.bb1b {
  width: 80%;
  height: 10%;
}

.bb1c {
  width: 90%;
  height: 10%;
}

.bb1d {
  width: 100%;
  height: 70%;
}


<!-- Step 13
Give your .bb1 element these style properties: display: flex;, flex-direction: column;, and align-items: center;. 
This will center the parts of the building using "flex" or "flexbox". You will learn about it in more detail on another project. -->

.bb1 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 70%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}


<!-- Step 14
Now you have something that is starting to resemble a building. Let's get into your first variable. 
Variable declarations begin with two dashes (-) and are given a name and a value like this: --variable-name: value;. In the .bb1 class, 
create a variable named --building-color1 and give it a value of #999. -->

.bb1 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 70%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  --building-color1: #999;
}


<!-- Step 15
To use a variable, put the variable name in parentheses with var in front of them like this: var(--variable-name). Add your variable as the value of the 
background-color property of the .bb1a class. Whatever value you gave the variable will be applied to whatever property you use it on. In this case, 
your variable has the value of #999. So #999 will be used as the value for the background-color property. -->

.bb1a {
  width: 70%;
  height: 10%;
  background-color: var(--building-color1);
}


<!-- Step 16
Use the same variable as the background-color of the .bb1b, .bb1c, and .bb1d classes to fill in the rest of the building. -->

.bb1b {
  width: 80%;
  height: 10%;
  background-color: var(--building-color1);
  
}

.bb1c {
  width: 90%;
  height: 10%;
  background-color: var(--building-color1);
}

.bb1d {
  width: 100%;
  height: 70%;
  background-color: var(--building-color1);
}


<!-- Step 17
I don't really like that color. Change the value of your variable from #999 to #aa80ff and you can see how it gets applied everywhere you used the variable. 
This is the main advantage of using variables, being able to quickly change many values in your stylesheet by just changing the value of a variable. -->

--building-color1: #aa80ff;


<!-- Step 18
Your first building looks pretty good now. Let's make some more! Nest three new div elements in the background-buildings container and give them 
the classes of bb2, bb3, and bb4 in that order. These will be three more buildings for the background. -->

<div class="bb2"></div>
<div class="bb3"></div>
<div class="bb4"></div>


<!-- Step 19
Give the new buildings width and height properties of: 10% and 50% for .bb2, 10% and 55% for .bb3, and 11% and 58% for .bb4. 
You will be using almost all percent based units and some flexbox for this project, so everything will be completely responsive. -->

.bb2 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 50%;
}

.bb3 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 55%;
}

.bb4 {
  width: 11%;
  height: 58%;
}


<!-- Step 20
The buildings are stacked on top of each other and running off the screen. Let's fix that. 
Add the properties display: flex;, align-items: flex-end;, and justify-content: space-evenly; to the background-buildings class. 
This will use flexbox again to evenly space the buildings across the bottom of the element. -->

.background-buildings {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-end;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
}
