<!-- Step 1
Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document 
so the browser knows what type of document it's reading. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>


<!-- Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. -->

<html></html>


<!-- Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element. -->

<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>


<!-- Step 4
Add a title element to the head, and give your project a title of City Skyline. Also, nest a self-closing link element in the head element. 
Give it a rel attribute value of stylesheet, a type attribute value of text/css, and an href attribute value of styles.css. -->

  <head>
    <title>City Skyline</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
  </head>


<!-- Step 5
In CSS, you can target everything with an asterisk. Add a border to everything by using the * selector, and giving it a border of 1px solid black. 
This is a trick I like to use to help visualize where elements are and their size. You will remove this later. -->

* {
  border: 1px solid black;
}


<!-- Step 6
Also add a box-sizing of border-box to everything. This will make it so the border you added doesn't add any size to your elements. -->

* {
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}


<!-- Step 7
You can see the body (it's the inner-most box on your page); the box around it is the html element. 
Make your body fill the whole viewport by giving it a height of 100vh. Remove the default margin from the body by setting the margin to 0. 
Finally, set the overflow property to hidden to hide any scroll bars that appear when something extends past the viewport. -->

body {
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}


<!-- Step 8
Create a div element in the body with a class of background-buildings. This will be a container for a group of buildings. -->

  <body>
    <div class="background-buildings"></div>
  </body>


<!-- Step 9
Give your background buildings element a width and height of 100% to make it the full width and height of its parent, the body. -->

.background-buildings {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}


<!-- Step 10
Nest a div with a class of bb1 in the background buildings container. Open your styles.css file, and give .bb1 a width of 10% and height of 70%. 
"bb" stands for "background building", this will be your first building. -->

    <div class="background-buildings">
      <div class="bb1"></div>
    </div>

.bb1 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 70%;
}
