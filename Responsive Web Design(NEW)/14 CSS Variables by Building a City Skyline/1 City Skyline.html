<!-- Step 1
Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document 
so the browser knows what type of document it's reading. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>


<!-- Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. -->

<html></html>


<!-- Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element. -->

<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>


<!-- Step 4
Add a title element to the head, and give your project a title of City Skyline. Also, nest a self-closing link element in the head element. 
Give it a rel attribute value of stylesheet, a type attribute value of text/css, and an href attribute value of styles.css. -->

  <head>
    <title>City Skyline</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
  </head>


<!-- Step 5
In CSS, you can target everything with an asterisk. Add a border to everything by using the * selector, and giving it a border of 1px solid black. 
This is a trick I like to use to help visualize where elements are and their size. You will remove this later. -->

* {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
