<!-- Step 36
Your magazine will have three primary sections. You already set the overall layout in the main rule, but you can adjust the placement in the child rules.

One option is the grid-column property, which is shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end. 
The grid-column property tells the grid item which grid line to start and end at.

Create a .heading rule and set the grid-column property to 2 / 3. This will tell the .heading element to start at grid line 2 and end at grid line 3. -->

.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
}


<!-- Step 37
Create a .text selector and give it a grid-column property set to 2 / 3. -->

.text {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
}


<!-- Step 38
For additional control over the layout of your content, you can have a CSS Grid within a CSS Grid.

Set the display property of your .heading selector to grid. -->
