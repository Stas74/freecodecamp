<!-- Step 36
Your magazine will have three primary sections. You already set the overall layout in the main rule, but you can adjust the placement in the child rules.

One option is the grid-column property, which is shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end. 
The grid-column property tells the grid item which grid line to start and end at.

Create a .heading rule and set the grid-column property to 2 / 3. This will tell the .heading element to start at grid line 2 and end at grid line 3. -->

.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
}


<!-- Step 37
Create a .text selector and give it a grid-column property set to 2 / 3. -->

.text {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
}


<!-- Step 38
For additional control over the layout of your content, you can have a CSS Grid within a CSS Grid.

Set the display property of your .heading selector to grid. -->

.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  display: grid;
}


<!-- Step 39
Now you can style the content of the .heading element with CSS Grid.

The CSS repeat() function is used to repeat a value, rather than writing it out manually, and is helpful for grid layouts. 
For example, setting the grid-template-columns property to repeat(20, 200px) would create 20 columns each 200px wide.

Give your .heading element a grid-template-columns property set to repeat(2, 1fr) to create two columns of equal width. -->

.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
}


<!-- Step 40
Give your .heading selector a row-gap property set to 1.5rem. -->

.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  row-gap: 1.5rem;
}
