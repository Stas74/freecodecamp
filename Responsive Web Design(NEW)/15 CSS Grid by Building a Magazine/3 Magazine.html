<!-- Step 36
Your magazine will have three primary sections. You already set the overall layout in the main rule, but you can adjust the placement in the child rules.

One option is the grid-column property, which is shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end. 
The grid-column property tells the grid item which grid line to start and end at.

Create a .heading rule and set the grid-column property to 2 / 3. This will tell the .heading element to start at grid line 2 and end at grid line 3. -->

.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
}


<!-- Step 37
Create a .text selector and give it a grid-column property set to 2 / 3. -->

.text {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
}


<!-- Step 38
For additional control over the layout of your content, you can have a CSS Grid within a CSS Grid.

Set the display property of your .heading selector to grid. -->

.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  display: grid;
}


<!-- Step 39
Now you can style the content of the .heading element with CSS Grid.

The CSS repeat() function is used to repeat a value, rather than writing it out manually, and is helpful for grid layouts. 
For example, setting the grid-template-columns property to repeat(20, 200px) would create 20 columns each 200px wide.

Give your .heading element a grid-template-columns property set to repeat(2, 1fr) to create two columns of equal width. -->

.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
}


<!-- Step 40
Give your .heading selector a row-gap property set to 1.5rem. -->

.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  row-gap: 1.5rem;
}


<!-- Step 41
Remember that the grid-column property determines which columns an element starts and ends at. 
There may be times where you are unsure of how many columns your grid will have, but you want an element to stop at the last column. 
To do this, you can use -1 for the end column.

Create a .hero selector and give it a grid-column property set to 1 / -1. This will tell the element to span the full width of the grid. -->

.hero {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
}


<!-- Step 42
Give the .hero selector a position property set to relative. -->

.hero {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
  position: relative;
}


<!-- Step 43
You should remove the temporary width attribute before writing the CSS for your .hero-img. -->

          <img
            src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
            alt="freecodecamp logo"
            loading="lazy"
            class="hero-img"
          />


<!-- Step 44
Create an img selector and give it a width property set to 100%, and an object-fit property set to cover.

The object-fit property tells the browser how to position the element within its container. 
In this case, cover will set the image to fill the container, cropping as needed to avoid changing the aspect ratio. -->

img {
  width: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}


<!-- Step 45
Create a .hero-title selector and give it a text-align property set to center, a color property set to orangered and a font-size property set to 8rem. -->

.hero-title {
  text-align: center;
  color: orangered;
  font-size: 8rem;
}


<!-- Step 46
The subtitle also needs to be styled. 
Create a .hero-subtitle selector and give it a font-size property set to 2.4rem, a color property set to orangered, and a text-align property set to center. -->

.hero-subtitle {
  font-size: 2.4rem;
  text-align: center;
  color: orangered;
}


<!-- Step 47
Create an .author selector and give it a font-size property set to 2rem and a font-family property set to Raleway with a fallback of sans-serif. -->

.author {
  font-size: 2rem;
  font-family: "Raleway", sans-serif;
}


<!-- Step 48
Create a .author-name a:hover selector and give it a background-color property set to #306203.

This will create a hover effect only for the a element within the .author-name, showing the original freeCodeCamp green in the background. -->

.author-name a:hover {
  background-color: #306203;
}


<!-- Step 49
Create a .publish-date selector and give it a color property of rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5). -->

.publish-date {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
}


<!-- Step 50
Create a .social-icons selector. Give it a display property set to grid, and a font-size property set to 3rem. -->

.social-icons {
  display: grid;
  font-size: 3rem;
}
