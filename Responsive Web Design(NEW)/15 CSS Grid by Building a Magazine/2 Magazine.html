<!-- Step 16
Create a fifth p element at the end of your .text element, and give it the following text: -->

<p>The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions and packing them into a single test description text. 
  Each project will involve dozens of tests like this. People will be coding the entire time, 
  rather than switching back and forth from "reading mode" to "coding mode".</p>


<!-- Step 17
Create one final p element at the end of your .text element and give it the following text: -->

<p>
  Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code
  editor passing one test after another, quickly building up a project.
  People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they
  experience when they build the required projects at the end of each
  certification. They'll get that sense of forward progress right from
  the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.
</p>


<!-- Step 18
Below your .text element, create a new section element and give it a class of text text-with-images. 
Within that, create an article element with a class set to brief-history, and an aside element with the class set to image-wrapper. -->

<section class="text text-with-images">
  <article class="brief-history"></article>
  <aside class="image-wrapper"></aside>
</section>


<!-- Step 19
Within your article element, create an h3 element with the class set to list-title and the text of A Brief History. 
Below that, create a p element with the text Of the Curriculum. Then create a ul element with the class lists. -->

        <article class="brief-history">
          <h3 class="list-title">A Brief History</h3>
          <p>Of the Curriculum</p>
          <ul class="lists"></ul>
        </article>


<!-- Step 20
Within your ul element, create six li elements. Add an h4 element with a class set to list-subtitle and a p element to each of your li elements.

Then give the h4 and p elements the following text content, in order, with each h4 using what's on the left side of the colon, 
and each p using what's on the right: -->

        <article class="brief-history">
          <h3 class="list-title">A Brief History</h3>
          <p>Of the Curriculum</p>
          <ul class="lists">
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V1 - 2014</h4>
                <p>We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.</p>              
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
              <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
              <p>We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on General Assembly's Dash course for these).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
              <p>We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data Visualization. 
                They each had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges. 
                For the other certs, we were still using external resources like Node School.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
              <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
              <p>We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was the biggest curriculum improvement to date.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>


<!-- Step 21
Within your aside element, create two img elements, a blockquote element, and a third img element. Give the blockquote element a class set to image-quote. -->
