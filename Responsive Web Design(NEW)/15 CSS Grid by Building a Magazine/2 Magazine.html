<!-- Step 16
Create a fifth p element at the end of your .text element, and give it the following text: -->

<p>The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions and packing them into a single test description text. 
  Each project will involve dozens of tests like this. People will be coding the entire time, 
  rather than switching back and forth from "reading mode" to "coding mode".</p>


<!-- Step 17
Create one final p element at the end of your .text element and give it the following text: -->

<p>
  Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code
  editor passing one test after another, quickly building up a project.
  People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they
  experience when they build the required projects at the end of each
  certification. They'll get that sense of forward progress right from
  the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.
</p>


<!-- Step 18
Below your .text element, create a new section element and give it a class of text text-with-images. 
Within that, create an article element with a class set to brief-history, and an aside element with the class set to image-wrapper. -->

<section class="text text-with-images">
  <article class="brief-history"></article>
  <aside class="image-wrapper"></aside>
</section>


<!-- Step 19
Within your article element, create an h3 element with the class set to list-title and the text of A Brief History. 
Below that, create a p element with the text Of the Curriculum. Then create a ul element with the class lists. -->

        <article class="brief-history">
          <h3 class="list-title">A Brief History</h3>
          <p>Of the Curriculum</p>
          <ul class="lists"></ul>
        </article>


<!-- Step 20
Within your ul element, create six li elements. Add an h4 element with a class set to list-subtitle and a p element to each of your li elements.

Then give the h4 and p elements the following text content, in order, with each h4 using what's on the left side of the colon, 
and each p using what's on the right: -->

        <article class="brief-history">
          <h3 class="list-title">A Brief History</h3>
          <p>Of the Curriculum</p>
          <ul class="lists">
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V1 - 2014</h4>
                <p>We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.</p>              
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
              <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
              <p>We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on General Assembly's Dash course for these).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
              <p>We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data Visualization. 
                They each had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges. 
                For the other certs, we were still using external resources like Node School.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
              <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
              <p>We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was the biggest curriculum improvement to date.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>


<!-- Step 21
Within your aside element, create two img elements, a blockquote element, and a third img element. Give the blockquote element a class set to image-quote. -->

        <aside class="image-wrapper">
          <img />
          <img />
          <blockquote class="image-quote"></blockquote>
          <img />
        </aside>


<!-- Step 22
Within the .image-wrapper element, give your first img element a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/random-quote-machine.png, 
an alt of image of the quote machine project, a class of image-1, a loading attribute set to lazy, a width attribute of 600, and a height attribute of 400. -->

<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/random-quote-machine.png" 
     alt="image of the quote machine project" class="image-1" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" />


<!-- Step 23
Within your .image-wrapper element, give the second img element a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/calc.png, 
an alt of image of a calculator project, a loading attribute set to lazy, a class set to image-2, a width attribute set to 400, and a height attribute set to 400. -->

<img 
            src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/calc.png"
            alt="image of a calculator project"
            loading="lazy"
            class="image-2"
            width="400"
            height="400"
          />


<!-- Step 24
Within your .image-wrapper element, give your third img element a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/survey-form-background.jpeg, 
an alt of four people working on code, a loading attribute of lazy, a class set to image-3, a width attribute set to 600, and a height attribute set to 400. -->

<img
            src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/survey-form-background.jpeg"
            alt="four people working on code"
            loading="lazy"
            class="image-3"
            width="600"
            height="400"
           />


<!-- Step 25
Within your .image-quote element, nest an hr element, a p element and a second hr element. 
Give the p element a class set to quote and the text 
The millions of people who are learning to code through freeCodeCamp will have an even better resource to help them learn these fundamentals.. -->

          <blockquote class="image-quote">
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="quote">The millions of people who are learning to code through freeCodeCamp will have 
              an even better resource to help them learn these fundamentals.</p>
            <hr></hr>
          </blockquote>


<!-- Step 26
To start your CSS, normalize the CSS rules by targeting all elements with *, including the ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors.  
Set the padding property and margin property both to 0. -->

*, ::before, ::after {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}


<!-- Step 27
Create an html selector and give it a font-size property set to 62.5%. This will set the default font size for your web page to 10px (the browser default is 16px).
This will make it easier for you to work with rem units later, as 2rem would be 20px.
Also, set the box-sizing property to border-box. -->

html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}


<!-- Step 28
Create a body selector. Set the font-family property to Baskervville, with a fallback of serif. 
Set the color property to linen and the background-color property to rgb(20, 30, 40). -->

body {
  font-family: 'Baskervville', serif;
  color: linen;
  background-color: rgb(20, 30, 40);
}


<!-- Step 29
Create an h1 selector, and set the font-family property to Anton with the fallback of sans-serif. -->

h1 {
  font-family: 'Anton', sans-serif;
}


<!-- Step 30
Create an h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 selector. Give it a font-family property set to Raleway with a fallback of sans-serif. -->

h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
}
