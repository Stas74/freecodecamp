<!-- Step 56
Your .text element is not a CSS Grid, but you can create columns within an element without using Grid by using the column-width property.

Give your .text selector a column-width property set to 25rem. -->

.text {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  letter-spacing: 0.6px;
  column-width: 25rem;
}


<!-- Step 57
Magazines often use justified text in their printed content to structure their layout and control the flow of their content. 
While this works in printed form, justified text on websites can be an accessibility concern, for example presenting challenges for folks with dyslexia.

To make your project look like a printed magazine, give the .text selector a text-align property set to justify. -->

.text {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  letter-spacing: 0.6px;
  column-width: 25rem;
  text-align: justify;
}


<!-- Step 58
The ::first-letter pseudo-selector allows you to target the first letter in the text content of an element.

Create a .first-paragraph::first-letter selector and set the font-size property to 6rem. Also give it a color property set to orangered to make it stand out. -->

.first-paragraph::first-letter {
  font-size: 6rem;
  color: orangered;
}


<!-- Step 59
The other text has been shifted out of place.
Move it into position by giving the .first-paragraph::first-letter selector a float property set to left and a margin-right property set to 1rem. -->

.first-paragraph::first-letter {
  font-size: 6rem;
  color: orangered;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 1rem;
}


<!-- Step 60
Create an hr selector, and give it a margin property set to 1.5rem 0. -->

hr {
  margin: 1.5rem 0;
}


<!-- Step 61
To give the hr a color, you need to adjust the border property. Give the hr selector a border property set to 1px solid rgba(120, 120, 120, 0.6). -->

hr {
  margin: 1.5rem 0;
  border: 1px solid rgba(120, 120, 120, 0.6);
}


<!-- Step 62
Create a .quote selector. Give it a color property set to #00beef, a font-size property set to 2.4rem, and a text-align property set to center. -->

.quote {
  color: #00beef;
  font-size: 2.4rem;
  text-align: center;
}


<!-- Step 63
To make the quote text stand out more, give the .quote selector a font-family property set to Raleway with a fallback of sans-serif. -->

.quote {
  color: #00beef;
  font-size: 2.4rem;
  text-align: center;
  font-family: "Raleway", sans-serif;
}


<!-- Step 64
A quote is not really a quote without proper quotation marks. You can add these with CSS pseudo selectors.
Create a .quote::before selector and set the content property to " with a space following it.
Also, create a .quote::after selector and set the content property to " with a space preceding it. -->

.quote::before {
  content: '" ';
}

.quote::after {
  content: ' "';
}


<!-- Step 65
Now it's time to style your second section. 
Note that it has the text and text-with-images values for the class attribute, which means it is already inheriting the styles from your .text rule.

Create a .text-with-images selector and set the display property to grid. -->

.text-with-images {
  display: grid;
}


<!-- Step 66
You will need to have a column for text and a column for images. Give the .text-with-images selector a grid-template-columns property set to 1fr 2fr. 
Also set the column-gap property to 3rem to provide more spacing between the columns. -->

.text-with-images {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  column-gap: 3rem;
}


<!-- Step 67
Give the .text-with-images selector a margin-bottom property set to 3rem. -->

.text-with-images {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  column-gap: 3rem;
  margin-bottom: 3rem;
}


<!-- Step 68
Create a .lists selector and set the list-style-type property to none. This will get rid of the bullet points on the list items. -->

.lists {
  list-style-type: none;
}


<!-- Step 69
Give the .lists selector a margin-top property set to 2rem. -->

.lists {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin-top: 2rem;
}


<!-- Step 70
Create a .lists li rule to target the list items within your .lists element. Give it a margin-bottom property set to 1.5rem. -->

.lists li {
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}
