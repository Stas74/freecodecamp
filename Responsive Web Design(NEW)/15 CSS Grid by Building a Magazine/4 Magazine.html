<!-- Step 56
Your .text element is not a CSS Grid, but you can create columns within an element without using Grid by using the column-width property.

Give your .text selector a column-width property set to 25rem. -->

.text {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  letter-spacing: 0.6px;
  column-width: 25rem;
}


<!-- Step 57
Magazines often use justified text in their printed content to structure their layout and control the flow of their content. 
While this works in printed form, justified text on websites can be an accessibility concern, for example presenting challenges for folks with dyslexia.

To make your project look like a printed magazine, give the .text selector a text-align property set to justify. -->

.text {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  letter-spacing: 0.6px;
  column-width: 25rem;
  text-align: justify;
}


<!-- Step 58
The ::first-letter pseudo-selector allows you to target the first letter in the text content of an element.

Create a .first-paragraph::first-letter selector and set the font-size property to 6rem. Also give it a color property set to orangered to make it stand out. -->

.first-paragraph::first-letter {
  font-size: 6rem;
  color: orangered;
}


<!-- Step 59
The other text has been shifted out of place.
Move it into position by giving the .first-paragraph::first-letter selector a float property set to left and a margin-right property set to 1rem. -->

.first-paragraph::first-letter {
  font-size: 6rem;
  color: orangered;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 1rem;
}


<!-- Step 60
Create an hr selector, and give it a margin property set to 1.5rem 0. -->

hr {
  margin: 1.5rem 0;
}
