<!-- Step 1
Begin with your standard HTML boilerplate. Add a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element, a head element, and a body element.

Add a <meta> tag with the appropriate charset and a <meta> tag for mobile responsiveness within the head element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>


<!-- Step 2
Add a title element with the text Magazine, a link element for the https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anton|Baskervville|Raleway&display=swap font stylesheet, 
a link for the https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css FontAwesome stylesheet, and a link for your ./styles.css stylesheet.

Your font stylesheet will load three separate fonts: Anton, Baskervville, and Raleway. -->

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Magazine</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anton|Baskervville|Raleway&display=swap">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
  </head>


<!-- Step 3
Within your body, create a main element. Then in that element, create a section with a class set to heading. -->

<main>
  <section class="heading"></section>
</main>


<!-- Step 4
Within your .heading element, create a header element with the class set to hero.

In that element, create an img element with the src set to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png, 
the alt set to freecodecamp logo, and the class set to hero-img.

The loading attribute on an img element can be set to lazy to tell the browser not to fetch the image resource until it is needed 
(as in, when the user scrolls the image into view). As an additional benefit, lazy loaded elements will not load until the non-lazy elements are loaded - 
this means users with slow internet connections can view the content of your page without having to wait for the images to load.

Give your new img element a loading attribute set to lazy. -->

    <main>
      <section class="heading">
        <header class="hero">
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png" alt="freecodecamp logo" class="hero-img" loading="lazy">
        </header>
      </section>
    </main>


<!-- Step 5
After your img element, add an h1 element with the class set to hero-title and the text set to OUR NEW CURRICULUM, 
followed by a p element with the class set to hero-subtitle and the text set to Our efforts to restructure our curriculum with a more project-based focus. -->

    <main>
      <section class="heading">
        <header class="hero">
          <img
            src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
            alt="freecodecamp logo"
            loading="lazy"
            class="hero-img"
          />
          <h1 class="hero-title">OUR NEW CURRICULUM</h1>
          <p class="hero-subtitle">Our efforts to restructure our curriculum with a more project-based focus</p>
        </header>
      </section>
    </main>
