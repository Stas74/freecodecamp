<!-- Step 1
Begin with your standard HTML boilerplate. Add a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element, a head element, and a body element.

Add a <meta> tag with the appropriate charset and a <meta> tag for mobile responsiveness within the head element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>


<!-- Step 2
Add a title element with the text Magazine, a link element for the https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anton|Baskervville|Raleway&display=swap font stylesheet, 
a link for the https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css FontAwesome stylesheet, and a link for your ./styles.css stylesheet.

Your font stylesheet will load three separate fonts: Anton, Baskervville, and Raleway. -->

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Magazine</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anton|Baskervville|Raleway&display=swap">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
  </head>


<!-- Step 3
Within your body, create a main element. Then in that element, create a section with a class set to heading. -->

<main>
  <section class="heading"></section>
</main>


<!-- Step 4
Within your .heading element, create a header element with the class set to hero.

In that element, create an img element with the src set to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png, 
the alt set to freecodecamp logo, and the class set to hero-img.

The loading attribute on an img element can be set to lazy to tell the browser not to fetch the image resource until it is needed 
(as in, when the user scrolls the image into view). As an additional benefit, lazy loaded elements will not load until the non-lazy elements are loaded - 
this means users with slow internet connections can view the content of your page without having to wait for the images to load.

Give your new img element a loading attribute set to lazy. -->

    <main>
      <section class="heading">
        <header class="hero">
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png" alt="freecodecamp logo" class="hero-img" loading="lazy">
        </header>
      </section>
    </main>


<!-- Step 5
After your img element, add an h1 element with the class set to hero-title and the text set to OUR NEW CURRICULUM, 
followed by a p element with the class set to hero-subtitle and the text set to Our efforts to restructure our curriculum with a more project-based focus. -->

    <main>
      <section class="heading">
        <header class="hero">
          <img
            src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
            alt="freecodecamp logo"
            loading="lazy"
            class="hero-img"
          />
          <h1 class="hero-title">OUR NEW CURRICULUM</h1>
          <p class="hero-subtitle">Our efforts to restructure our curriculum with a more project-based focus</p>
        </header>
      </section>
    </main>


<!-- Step 6
Your image currently takes up a lot of space. To better see what you are working on, add a width attribute to the img element, with a value of 400.
You will remove this later on when you have worked on the CSS. -->

    <main>
      <section class="heading">
        <header class="hero">
          <img
            src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
            alt="freecodecamp logo"
            loading="lazy"
            class="hero-img"
            width="400"
          />
          <h1 class="hero-title">OUR NEW CURRICULUM</h1>
          <p class="hero-subtitle">
            Our efforts to restructure our curriculum with a more project-based
            focus
          </p>
        </header>
      </section>
    </main>


<!-- Step 7
After your header element, create a div with the class set to author.

Within that div, create a p element with the class set to author-name and give it the text By freeCodeCamp.
Wrap the freeCodeCamp portion in an a element with the href set to https://freecodecamp.org, and the target set to _blank.

Below that, add a second p element with the class publish-date and the text March 7, 2019. -->

        <div class="author">
          <p class="author-name">By <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a></p>
          <p class="publish-date">March 7, 2019</p>
        </div>


<!-- Step 8
The Referer HTTP header contains information about the address or URL of a page that a user might be visiting from. 
This information can be used in analytics to track how many users from your page visit freecodecamp.org, for example. 
Setting the rel attribute to noreferrer omits this information from the HTTP request. Give your a element a rel attribute set to noreferrer. -->

        <div class="author">
          <p class="author-name">
            By
            <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
              >freeCodeCamp</a
            >
          </p>
          <p class="publish-date">March 7, 2019</p>
        </div>


<!-- Step 9
Below your .author element, create a new div element with the class social-icons.

Add five a elements within that new div, and give them the following href attributes.

The first a element should have an href set to https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp.
The second a element should have an href set to https://twitter.com/freecodecamp.
The third a element should have an href set to https://instagram.com/freecodecamp.
The fourth a element should have an href set to https://www.linkedin.com/school/free-code-camp.
The fifth a element should have an href set to https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp. -->

<div class="social-icons">
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp"></a>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/freecodecamp"></a>
  <a href="https://instagram.com/freecodecamp"></a>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/free-code-camp"></a>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp"></a>
</div>


<!-- Step 10
Within each of your new a elements, add an i element and give them the following classes:

Your first i element should have the class fab fa-facebook-f
Your second i element should have the class fab fa-twitter
Your third i element should have the class fab fa-instagram
Your fourth i element should have the class fab fa-linkedin-in
Your fifth i element should have the class fab fa-youtube -->

        <div class="social-icons">
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp/"><i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i>
          </a>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/freecodecamp/"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
          </a>
          <a href="https://instagram.com/freecodecamp"><i class="fab fa-instagram"></i>
          </a>
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/free-code-camp/"><i class="fab fa-linkedin-in"></i>
          </a>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp"><i class="fab fab fa-youtube"></i>
          </a>
        </div>


<!-- Step 11
Below your .heading element, create a new section element with the class set to text. 
Within that, create a p element with the class set to first-paragraph and the following text:
Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding challenges, you'll learn through building projects - 
step by step. Before we get into the details, let me emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. 
All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges. -->

<section class="text">
  <p class="first-paragraph">Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. 
    Instead of a series of coding challenges, you'll learn through building projects - step by step.
    Before we get into the details, let me emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. 
    All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges.</p>
</section>


<!-- Step 12
Create another p element below your .first-paragraph element, and give it the following text:
After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my head on the sink, and when I came to I had a revelation! 
A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is what makes time travel possible: the flux capacitor! -->
