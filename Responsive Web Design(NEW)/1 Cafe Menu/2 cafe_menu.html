<!-- Step 31
article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information. 
In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for that flavor. 
Nest two p elements inside your article element. The first one's text should be French Vanilla, and the second's text 3.00. -->

          <article>
            <p>French Vanilla</p>
            <p>3.00</p>
          </article>


<!-- Step 32
Starting below the existing coffee/price pair, add the following coffee and prices using article elements with two nested p elements inside each. 
As before, the first p element's text should contain the coffee flavor and the second p element's text should contain the price.

Caramel Macchiato 3.75
Pumpkin Spice 3.50
Hazelnut 4.00
Mocha 4.50 -->

          </article>

            <p>Caramel Macchiato</p>
            <p>3.75</p>

          <article>
            <p>Pumpkin Spice</p>
            <p>3.50</p>
          </article>

            <p>Mocha</p>
            <p>4.50</p>
          </article>


<!-- Step 33
The flavors and prices are currently stacked on top of each other and centered with their respective p elements. 
It would be nice if the flavor was on the left and the price was on the right.

Add the class name flavor to the French Vanilla p element. -->

            <p class="flavor">French Vanilla</p>
            <p>3.00</p>


<!-- Step 34
Using your new flavor class as a selector, set the text-align property's value to left. -->

.flavor {
  text-align: left;
}


<!-- Step 35
Next, you want to align the price to the right. Add a class named price to your p element that has 3.00 as its text. -->

            <p class="price">3.00</p>


<!-- Step 36
Now align the text to the right for the elements with the price class. -->

.price {
  text-align: right;
}


<!-- Step 37
That is kind of what you want, but now it would be nice if the flavor and price were on the same line. 
p elements are block-level elements, so they take up the entire width of their parent element.

To get them on the same line, you need to apply some styling to the p elements, so they behave more like inline elements. 
Add a class attribute with the value item to the first article element under the Coffee heading. -->

          <h2>Coffee</h2>
          <article class="item">
            <p class="flavor">French Vanilla</p>
            <p class="price">3.00</p>
          </article>


<!-- Step 38
The p elements are nested in an article element with the class attribute of item. 
You can style all the p elements nested anywhere in elements with a class named item like this:

.item p { }
Using the above selector, add a display property with value inline-block so the p elements behave more like inline elements. -->

.item p {
  display: inline-block;
}


<!-- Step 39
That's closer, but the price didn't stay over on the right. 
This is because inline-block elements only take up the width of their content. 
To spread them out, add a width property to the flavor and price class selectors that have a value of 50% each. -->

.flavor {
  text-align: left;
  width: 50%;
}
.price {
  text-align: right;
  width: 50%;
}
