<!-- Step 31
article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information. 
In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for that flavor. 
Nest two p elements inside your article element. The first one's text should be French Vanilla, and the second's text 3.00. -->

          <article>
            <p>French Vanilla</p>
            <p>3.00</p>
          </article>


<!-- Step 32
Starting below the existing coffee/price pair, add the following coffee and prices using article elements with two nested p elements inside each. 
As before, the first p element's text should contain the coffee flavor and the second p element's text should contain the price.

Caramel Macchiato 3.75
Pumpkin Spice 3.50
Hazelnut 4.00
Mocha 4.50 -->

<!-- Step 33
The flavors and prices are currently stacked on top of each other and centered with their respective p elements. 
It would be nice if the flavor was on the left and the price was on the right.

Add the class name flavor to the French Vanilla p element. -->

            <p class="flavor">French Vanilla</p>
            <p>3.00</p>


<!-- Step 34
Using your new flavor class as a selector, set the text-align property's value to left. -->

.flavor {
  text-align: left;
}


<!-- Step 35
Next, you want to align the price to the right. Add a class named price to your p element that has 3.00 as its text. -->

            <p class="price">3.00</p>
