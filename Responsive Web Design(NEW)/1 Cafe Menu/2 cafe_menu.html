<!-- Step 31
article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information. 
In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for that flavor. 
Nest two p elements inside your article element. The first one's text should be French Vanilla, and the second's text 3.00. -->

          <article>
            <p>French Vanilla</p>
            <p>3.00</p>
          </article>


<!-- Step 32
Starting below the existing coffee/price pair, add the following coffee and prices using article elements with two nested p elements inside each. 
As before, the first p element's text should contain the coffee flavor and the second p element's text should contain the price.

Caramel Macchiato 3.75
Pumpkin Spice 3.50
Hazelnut 4.00
Mocha 4.50 -->

          <article>
            <p>French Vanilla</p>
            <p>3.00</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <p>Caramel Macchiato</p>
            <p>3.75</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <p>Pumpkin Spice</p>
            <p>3.50</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <p>Hazelnut</p>
            <p>4.00</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <p>Mocha</p>
            <p>4.50</p>
          </article>


<!-- Step 33
The flavors and prices are currently stacked on top of each other and centered with their respective p elements. 
It would be nice if the flavor was on the left and the price was on the right.

Add the class name flavor to the French Vanilla p element. -->

            <p class="flavor">French Vanilla</p>
            <p>3.00</p>


<!-- Step 34
Using your new flavor class as a selector, set the text-align property's value to left. -->

.flavor {
  text-align: left;
}


<!-- Step 35
Next, you want to align the price to the right. Add a class named price to your p element that has 3.00 as its text. -->

            <p class="price">3.00</p>


<!-- Step 36
Now align the text to the right for the elements with the price class. -->

.price {
  text-align: right;
}


<!-- Step 37
That is kind of what you want, but now it would be nice if the flavor and price were on the same line. 
p elements are block-level elements, so they take up the entire width of their parent element.

To get them on the same line, you need to apply some styling to the p elements, so they behave more like inline elements. 
Add a class attribute with the value item to the first article element under the Coffee heading. -->

          <h2>Coffee</h2>
          <article class="item">
            <p class="flavor">French Vanilla</p>
            <p class="price">3.00</p>
          </article>


<!-- Step 38
The p elements are nested in an article element with the class attribute of item. 
You can style all the p elements nested anywhere in elements with a class named item like this:

.item p { }
Using the above selector, add a display property with value inline-block so the p elements behave more like inline elements. -->

.item p {
  display: inline-block;
}


<!-- Step 39
That's closer, but the price didn't stay over on the right. 
This is because inline-block elements only take up the width of their content. 
To spread them out, add a width property to the flavor and price class selectors that have a value of 50% each. -->

.flavor {
  text-align: left;
  width: 50%;
}
.price {
  text-align: right;
  width: 50%;
}


<!-- Step 40
Well that did not work. Styling the p elements as inline-block and placing them on separate lines in the code 
creates an extra space to the right of the first p element, causing the second one to shift to the next line. 
One way to fix this is to make each p element's width a little less than 50%.

Change the width value to 49% for each class to see what happens. -->

.flavor {
  text-align: left;
  width: 49%;
}
.price {
  text-align: right;
  width: 49%;
}


<!-- Step 41
That worked, but there is still a little space on the right of the price.

You could keep trying various percentages for the widths. 
Instead, simply move the price p element to be on the same line and make sure there is no space between them. -->

            <p class="flavor">French Vanilla</p><p class="price">3.00</p>


<!-- Step 42
Now go ahead and change both the flavor and price class' widths to be 50% again. -->

.flavor {
  text-align: left;
  width: 50%;
}
.price {
  text-align: right;
  width: 50%;
}


<!-- Step 43
Now that you know it works, you can change the remaining article and p elements to match the first set. 
Start by adding the class item to the other article elements. -->

          <article class="item">
            <p>Caramel Macchiato</p>
            <p>3.75</p>
          </article>
...................


<!-- Step 44
Next, position the other p elements to be on the same line with no space between them. -->

          <article class="item">
            <p>Caramel Macchiato</p><p>3.75</p>
          </article>
..................


<!-- Step 45
To complete the styling, add the applicable class names flavor and price to all the remaining p elements. -->

          <article class="item">
            <p class="flavor">Caramel Macchiato</p><p class="price">3.75</p>
          </article>
..................


<!-- Step 46
If you make the width of the page preview smaller, you will notice at some point, some of the text on the left starts wrapping around to the next line. 
This is because the width of the p elements on the left side can only take up 50% of the space.

Since you know the prices on the right have significantly fewer characters, change the flavor class width value to be 75% and the price class width value to be 25%. -->

.flavor {
  text-align: left;
  width: 75%;
}
.price {
  text-align: right;
  width: 25%;
}


<!-- Step 47
You will come back to styling the menu in a few steps, 
but for now, go ahead and add a second section element below the first for displaying the desserts offered by the cafe. -->

        <section>
        </section>


<!-- Step 48
Add an h2 element in the new section and give it the text Desserts. -->

        <section>
          <h2>Desserts</h2>
        </section>


<!-- Step 49
Add an empty article element under the Desserts heading. Give it a class attribute with the value item. -->

          <h2>Desserts</h2>
          <article class="item">
          </article>


Step 50
Nest two p elements inside your article element. 
The first one's text should be Donut, and the second's text 1.50. Put both of them on the same line making sure there is no space between them.

          <article class="item">
            <p>Donut</p><p>1.50</p>
          </article>
