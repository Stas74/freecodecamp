<!-- Step 63
The typography of heading elements (e.g. h1, h2) is set by default values of users' browsers.

Add two new type selectors (h1 and h2). Use the font-size property for both, but use the value 40px for the h1 and 30px for the h2. -->

h1 {
  font-size: 40px;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 30px;
}


<!-- Step 64
Add a footer element below the main element, where you can add some additional information. -->

      <footer>
      </footer>


<!-- Step 65
Inside the footer, add a p element. Then, nest an anchor (a) element in the p that links to https://www.freecodecamp.org and has the text Visit our website. -->

      <footer>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Visit our website</a>
        </p>
      </footer>


<!-- Step 66
Add a second p element below the one with the link and give it the text 123 Free Code Camp Drive. -->

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit our website</a>
        </p>


<!-- Step 67
You can use an hr element to display a divider between sections of different content.

First, add an hr element between the first header element and the main element. Note that hr elements are self closing. -->

      <header>
        ///////
      </header>
      <hr>
      <main>
        /////////
      </main>


<!-- Step 68
The default properties of an hr element will make it appear as a thin light grey line. 
You can change the height of the line by specifying a value for the height property.

Change the height the hr element to be 3px. -->

hr {
  height: 3px;
}


<!-- Step 69
Change the background color of the hr element to brown so it matches the color of the coffee beans. -->

hr {
  height: 3px;
  background-color: brown;
}


<!-- Step 70
Notice the grey color along the edges of the line. Those edges are known as borders. Each side of an element can have a different color or they can all be the same.

Make all the edges of the hr element the same color as the background of it using the border-color property. -->

hr {
  height: 3px;
  background-color: brown;
  border-color: brown;
}
