<!-- Step 63
The typography of heading elements (e.g. h1, h2) is set by default values of users' browsers.

Add two new type selectors (h1 and h2). Use the font-size property for both, but use the value 40px for the h1 and 30px for the h2. -->

h1 {
  font-size: 40px;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 30px;
}


<!-- Step 64
Add a footer element below the main element, where you can add some additional information. -->

      <footer>
      </footer>


<!-- Step 65
Inside the footer, add a p element. Then, nest an anchor (a) element in the p that links to https://www.freecodecamp.org and has the text Visit our website. -->

      <footer>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Visit our website</a>
        </p>
      </footer>


<!-- Step 66
Add a second p element below the one with the link and give it the text 123 Free Code Camp Drive. -->

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit our website</a>
        </p>


<!-- Step 67
You can use an hr element to display a divider between sections of different content.

First, add an hr element between the first header element and the main element. Note that hr elements are self closing. -->

      <header>
        ///////
      </header>
      <hr>
      <main>
        /////////
      </main>


<!-- Step 68
The default properties of an hr element will make it appear as a thin light grey line. 
You can change the height of the line by specifying a value for the height property.

Change the height the hr element to be 3px. -->

hr {
  height: 3px;
}


<!-- Step 69
Change the background color of the hr element to brown so it matches the color of the coffee beans. -->

hr {
  height: 3px;
  background-color: brown;
}


<!-- Step 70
Notice the grey color along the edges of the line. Those edges are known as borders. Each side of an element can have a different color or they can all be the same.

Make all the edges of the hr element the same color as the background of it using the border-color property. -->

hr {
  height: 3px;
  background-color: brown;
  border-color: brown;
}


<!-- Step 71
Notice how the thickness of the line looks bigger? 
The default value of a property named border-width is 1px for all edges of hr elements. 
By changing the border to the same color as the background, the total height of the line is 5px (3px plus the top and bottom border width of 1px).
Change the height property of the hr to be 2px, so the total height of it becomes 4px. -->

hr {
  height: 2px;
  background-color: brown;
  border-color: brown;
}


<!-- Step 72
Go ahead and add another hr element between the main element and the footer element. -->

      </main>
      <hr>
..................      


<!-- Step 73
To create a little more room around the menu, add 20px of space on the inside of the body element by using the padding property. -->

body {
  background-image: url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/beans.jpg);
  font-family: sans-serif;
  padding: 20px;
}


<!-- Step 74
Focusing on the menu items and prices, there is a fairly large gap between each line.

Target all the p elements nested in elements with the class named item and set their top and bottom margin to be 5px. -->

.item p {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-top: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}


<!-- Step 75
Using the same style selector in the previous step, make the font size of the items and prices larger by using a value of 18px. -->

.item p {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-top: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
  font-size: 18px;
}


<!-- Step 76
Changing the margin-bottom to 5px looks great. 
However, now the space between the Cinnamon Roll menu item and the second hr element does not match the space between the top hr element and the Coffee heading.

Add some more space by creating a class named bottom-line using 25px for the margin-top property. -->

.bottom-line {
  margin-top: 25px;
}


<!-- Step 77
Now add the bottom-line class to the second hr element so the styling is applied. -->

      <hr class="bottom-line">


<!-- Step 78
Next you are going to be styling the footer element. To keep the CSS organized, add a comment at the end of styles.css with the text FOOTER. -->

/* FOOTER */


<!-- Step 79
Moving down to the footer element, make all the text have a value of 14px for the font size. -->

footer {
  font-size: 14px;
}


<!-- Step 80
The default color of a link that has not yet been clicked on is typically blue. 
The default color of a link that has already been visited from a page is typically purple.

To make the footer links the same color regardless if a link has been visited, 
use a type selector for the anchor element (a) and use the value black for the color property. -->

a {
  color: black;
}


<!-- Step 81
You change properties of a link when the link has actually been visited by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:visited { propertyName: propertyValue; }.

Change the color of the footer Visit our website link to be grey when a user has visited the link. -->

a:visited {
  color: grey;
}


<!-- Step 82
You change properties of a link when the mouse hovers over them by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:hover { propertyName: propertyValue; }.

Change the color of the footer Visit our website link to be brown when a user hovers over it. -->

a:hover {
  color: brown;
}


<!-- Step 83
You change properties of a link when the link is actually being clicked by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:active { propertyName: propertyValue; }.

Change the color of the footer Visit our website link to be white when clicked on. -->

a:active {
  color: white;
}


<!-- Step 84
To keep with the same color theme you have already been using (black and brown), 
change the color for when the link is visited to black and use brown for when the link is actually clicked. -->

a:visited {
  color: black;
}

a:hover {
  color: brown;
}

a:active {
  color: brown;
}


<!-- Step 85
The menu text CAMPER CAFE has a different space from the top than the address at the bottom of the menu. 
This is due to the browser having some default top margin for the h1 element.

Change the top margin of the h1 element to 0 to remove all the top margin. -->

h1 {
  font-size: 40px;
  margin-top: 0px;
}


<!-- Step 86
To remove some of the vertical space between the h1 element and the text Est. 2020, change the bottom margin of the h1 to 15px. -->

h1 {
  font-size: 40px;
  margin-top: 0;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
}


<!-- Step 87
Now the top spacing looks good. 
The space below the address at the bottom of the menu is a little bigger than the space at the top of the menu and the h1 element.

To decrease the default margin space below the address p element, create a class selector named address and use the value 5px for the margin-bottom property. -->

.address {
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}


<!-- Step 88
Now apply the address class to the p element containing the address. -->

      <footer>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Visit our website</a>
        </p>
        <p class="address">123 Free Code Camp Drive</p>
      </footer>


<!-- Step 89
The menu looks good, but other than the coffee beans background image, it is mainly just text.

Under the Coffee heading, add an image using the url https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/coffee.jpg. Give the image an alt value of coffee icon. -->

          <h2>Coffee</h2>
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/coffee.jpg" alt="coffee icon">


<!-- Step 90
The image you added is not centered horizontally like the Coffee heading above it. img elements are "like" inline elements.

To make the image behave like heading elements (which are block-level), 
create an img type selector and use the value block for the display property and use the applicable margin-left and margin-right values to center it horizontally. -->

img {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
