<!-- Step 1
As you learned in the last few steps of the Cat Photo App, there is a basic structure needed to start building your web page.
Add the <!DOCTYPE html> tag, and an html element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>


<!-- Step 2
Add a head element within the html element, so you can add a title element. The title element's text should be Cafe Menu. -->

<head>
  <title>Cafe Menu</title>
</head>


<!-- Step 3
The title is one of several elements that provide extra information not visible on the web page, but it is useful for search engines or how the page gets displayed.

Inside the head element, nest a meta element with an attribute named charset set to the value utf-8 to tell the browser 
how to encode characters for the page. Note that meta elements are self-closing. -->

  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
  </head>


<!-- Step 4
To prepare to create some actual content, add a body element below the head element. -->
  <body>
  </body>

<!-- Step 5
The name of the cafe is CAMPER CAFE. Add an h1 element within your body element. 
Give it the name of the cafe in capitalized letters to make it stand out. -->

  <body>
    <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
  </body>


<!-- Step 6
To let visitors know the cafe was founded in 2020, add a p element below the h1 element with the text Est. 2020. -->

    <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
    <p>Est. 2020</p>


<!-- Step 7
Since the p element added in the previous step provides supplemental information about the cafe, nest both the h1 and p elements in a header element. -->

    <header>
      <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
      <p>Est. 2020</p>
    </header>


<!-- Step 8
It's time to add some menu content. Add a main element below the existing header element. 
It will eventually contain pricing information about coffee and desserts offered by the cafe. -->

    <main>
    </main>


<!-- Step 9
There will be two sections on the menu, one for coffees and one for desserts. 
Add a section element within the main element so you have a place to put all the coffees available. -->

    <main>
      <section>
      </section>
    </main>


<!-- Step 10
Create an h2 element in the section element and give it the text Coffee. -->

      <section>
        <h2>Coffee</h2>
      </section>


<!-- Step 11
Up until now, you have been limited regarding the presentation and appearance of the content you create. 
To start taking control, add a style element within the head element. -->

  <head>
    <style></style>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
  </head>


<!-- Step 12
You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:

element {
 property: value;
}
Center your h1 element by setting its text-align property to the value center. -->

    <style>
      h1 {
        text-align: center;
      }
    </style>


<!-- Step 13
In the previous step, you used a type selector to style the h1 element. Go ahead and center the h2 and p elements with a new type selector for each one. -->

    <style>
      h1 {
        text-align: center;
      }
      h2 {
        text-align: center;
      }
      p {
        text-align: center;
      }
    </style>


<!-- Step 14
You now have three type selectors with the exact same styling. 
You can add the same group of styles to many elements by separating the selectors with commas like this:

selector1, selector2 {
  property: value;
}
Use a single type selector to center the h1, h2 and p elements at the same time. -->

    <style>
      h1, h2, p {
        text-align: center;
      }
    </style>


<!-- Step 15
You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the style tags. 
This works, but since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.
We have created a separate styles.css file for you and switched the editor view to that file. You can change between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.

Start by rewriting the styles you have created into the styles.css file. Make sure to exclude the opening and closing style tags. -->

h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
    }


<!-- Step 16
Now that you have the CSS in the styles.css file, go ahead and remove the style element and all its content. 
Once it is removed, the text that was centered will shift back to the left. -->

  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>    
  </head>


<!-- Step 17
Now you need to link the styles.css file so the styles will be applied again. 
Nest a self-closing link element in the head element. Give it a rel attribute value stylesheet, 
a type attribute value of text/css, and an href attribute value of styles.css. -->

  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
  </head>


<!-- Step 18
For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.
Add the following within the head element:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> -->

  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  </head>


<!-- Step 19
The text is centered again so the link to the CSS file is working. 
Add another style to the file that changes the background-color property to brown for the body element. -->

h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
}
body {
  background-color: brown;
}


<!-- Step 20
That brown background makes it hard to read the text. 
Change the body element's background color to be burlywood so it has some color but you are still be able to read the text. -->

body {
  background-color: burlywood ;
}
