<!-- Step 15
Continuing the pattern, select the following .cabin elements and apply the specific rules to them:

The second .cabin should have the right property set to 17% and the top property set to 93.5%.
The third .cabin should have the right property set to 67% and the top property set to 93.5%.
The fourth .cabin should have the left property set to -8.5% and the top property set to 50%.
The fifth .cabin should have the left property set to 17% and the top property set to 7%.
The sixth .cabin should have the right property set to 17% and the top property set to 7%. -->

.cabin:nth-of-type(2) {
  right: 17%;
  top: 93.5%;
}

.cabin:nth-of-type(3) {
  right: 67%;
  top: 93.5%;
}

.cabin:nth-of-type(4) {
  left: -8.5%;
  top: 50%;
}

.cabin:nth-of-type(5) {
  left: 17%;
  top: 7%;
}

.cabin:nth-of-type(6) {
  right: 17%;
  top: 7%;
}


<!-- Step 16
The @keyframes at-rule is used to define the flow of a CSS animation. Within the @keyframes rule, you can create selectors for specific points in 
the animation sequence, such as 0% or 25%, or use from and to to define the start and end of the sequence.

@keyframes rules require a name to be assigned to them, which you use in other rules to reference. 
For example, the @keyframes freeCodeCamp { } rule would be named freeCodeCamp.

Time to start animating. Create a @keyframes rule named wheel. -->

@keyframes wheel {}


<!-- Step 17
You now need to define how your animation should start. To do this, create a 0% rule within your @keyframes wheel rule. 
The properties you set in this nested selector will apply at the beginning of your animation.

As an example, this would be a 12% rule:

@keyframes freecodecamp {
  12% {
    color: green;
  }
} -->

@keyframes wheel {
  0% {}
}


<!-- Step 18
Give the 0% rule a transform property set to rotate(0deg). This will start the animation with no rotation. -->

@keyframes wheel {
   0% {
     transform: rotate(0deg);
   }
}


<!-- Step 19
Now give the @keyframes wheel rule a 100% selector. Within that, set the transform to rotate(360deg). 
By doing this, your animation will now complete a full rotation. -->

@keyframes wheel {
   0% {
     transform: rotate(0deg);
   }
   100% {
     transform: rotate(360deg);
   }
}


<!-- Step 20
The animation-name property is used to link a @keyframes rule to a CSS selector. The value of this property should match the name of the @keyframes rule. 
Give your .wheel selector an animation-name property set to wheel.

The animation-duration property is used to set how long the animation should sequence to complete. 
The time should be specified in either seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms). Set your .wheel selector to have an animation-duration property of 10s. -->

.wheel {
  border: 2px solid black;
  border-radius: 50%;
  margin-left: 50px;
  position: absolute;
  height: 55vw;
  width: 55vw;
  max-width: 500px;
  max-height: 500px;
  animation-name: wheel;
  animation-duration: 10s;
}
