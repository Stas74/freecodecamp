<!-- Step 15
Continuing the pattern, select the following .cabin elements and apply the specific rules to them:

The second .cabin should have the right property set to 17% and the top property set to 93.5%.
The third .cabin should have the right property set to 67% and the top property set to 93.5%.
The fourth .cabin should have the left property set to -8.5% and the top property set to 50%.
The fifth .cabin should have the left property set to 17% and the top property set to 7%.
The sixth .cabin should have the right property set to 17% and the top property set to 7%. -->

.cabin:nth-of-type(2) {
  right: 17%;
  top: 93.5%;
}

.cabin:nth-of-type(3) {
  right: 67%;
  top: 93.5%;
}

.cabin:nth-of-type(4) {
  left: -8.5%;
  top: 50%;
}

.cabin:nth-of-type(5) {
  left: 17%;
  top: 7%;
}

.cabin:nth-of-type(6) {
  right: 17%;
  top: 7%;
}


<!-- Step 16
The @keyframes at-rule is used to define the flow of a CSS animation. Within the @keyframes rule, you can create selectors for specific points in 
the animation sequence, such as 0% or 25%, or use from and to to define the start and end of the sequence.

@keyframes rules require a name to be assigned to them, which you use in other rules to reference. 
For example, the @keyframes freeCodeCamp { } rule would be named freeCodeCamp.

Time to start animating. Create a @keyframes rule named wheel. -->

@keyframes wheel {}


<!-- Step 17
You now need to define how your animation should start. To do this, create a 0% rule within your @keyframes wheel rule. 
The properties you set in this nested selector will apply at the beginning of your animation.

As an example, this would be a 12% rule:

@keyframes freecodecamp {
  12% {
    color: green;
  }
} -->

@keyframes wheel {
  0% {}
}


<!-- Step 18
Give the 0% rule a transform property set to rotate(0deg). This will start the animation with no rotation. -->

@keyframes wheel {
   0% {
     transform: rotate(0deg);
   }
}


<!-- Step 19
Now give the @keyframes wheel rule a 100% selector. Within that, set the transform to rotate(360deg). 
By doing this, your animation will now complete a full rotation. -->

@keyframes wheel {
   0% {
     transform: rotate(0deg);
   }
   100% {
     transform: rotate(360deg);
   }
}


<!-- Step 20
The animation-name property is used to link a @keyframes rule to a CSS selector. The value of this property should match the name of the @keyframes rule. 
Give your .wheel selector an animation-name property set to wheel.

The animation-duration property is used to set how long the animation should sequence to complete. 
The time should be specified in either seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms). Set your .wheel selector to have an animation-duration property of 10s. -->

.wheel {
  border: 2px solid black;
  border-radius: 50%;
  margin-left: 50px;
  position: absolute;
  height: 55vw;
  width: 55vw;
  max-width: 500px;
  max-height: 500px;
  animation-name: wheel;
  animation-duration: 10s;
}


<!-- Step 21
The animation-iteration-count property sets how many times your animation should repeat. This can be set to a number, or to infinite to indefinitely repeat 
the animation. Your Ferris wheel should never stop, so set the .wheel selector to have an animation-iteration-count of infinite.

The animation-timing-function property sets how the animation should progress over time. There are a few different values for this property, 
but you want the Ferris wheel animation to run at the same rate from start to finish. Set the animation-timing-function to linear in your .wheel selector. -->

.wheel {
  border: 2px solid black;
  border-radius: 50%;
  margin-left: 50px;
  position: absolute;
  height: 55vw;
  width: 55vw;
  max-width: 500px;
  max-height: 500px;
  animation-name: wheel;
  animation-duration: 10s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
}


<!-- Step 22
Create another @keyframes rule with the name cabins. 
Use the same properties as your @keyframes wheel, copying both the 0% and 100% rules, but set the transform property of the 100% selector to rotate(-360deg). -->

@keyframes cabins {
  0% {
     transform: rotate(0deg);
   }
   100% {
     transform: rotate(-360deg);
   }
}


<!-- Step 23
With your .wheel selector, you created four different properties to control the animation. 
For your .cabin selector, you can use the animation property to set these all at once.

Set the animation property of the .cabin rule to cabins 10s linear infinite. 
This will set the animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, and animation-iteration-count properties in that order. -->

.cabin {
  background-color: red;
  width: 20%;
  height: 20%;
  position: absolute;
  border: 2px solid;
  transform-origin: 50% 0%;
  animation: cabins 10s linear infinite;
}


<!-- Step 24
To make your cabin animation seem more like a natural swinging motion, you can use the ease-in-out timing function. 
This setting will tell the animation to start and end at a slower pace, but move more quickly in the middle of the cycle.

Replace linear to ease-in-out in the .cabin selector. -->

.cabin {
  background-color: red;
  width: 20%;
  height: 20%;
  position: absolute;
  border: 2px solid;
  transform-origin: 50% 0%;
  animation: cabins 10s ease-in-out infinite;
}


<!-- Step 25
You can use @keyframes rules to control more than just the transformation of an element. 
In the 0% selector of your @keyframes cabins, set the background-color to yellow. -->

@keyframes cabins {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
    background-color: yellow;
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotate(-360deg);
  }
}
