<!-- 1 Change the Color of Text
Now let's change the color of some of our text.
We can do this by changing the style of your h2 element.
The property that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the color style property.
Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue:

<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
Note that it is a good practice to end inline style declarations with a ; . -->

<h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <div>
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
    <ul>

<!-- 2 Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements
With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS properties that you can use to change the way an element looks on your page.

When you entered <h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>, 
you were styling that individual h2 element with inline CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
That's one way to specify the style of an element, but there's a better way to apply CSS.

At the top of your code, create a style block like this:
<style>
</style>

Inside that style block, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. 
For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this:

<style>
  h2 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style rule(s). 
You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags. 
Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style rules. -->

<style>
  h2 {
   color: blue;
  }
</style>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
<!--   ....... -->
</main>


<!-- 3 Use a CSS Class to Style an Element
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.
Here's an example CSS class declaration:

<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag. 
You can apply a class to an HTML element like this: <h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>. 
Note that in your CSS style element, class names start with a period. 
In your HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period. -->

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
  <!--   ....... -->
</main>


<!-- 4 Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class
Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements. You can see this by applying your red-text class to the first p element. -->

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
  <!--   ....... -->
</main>


<!-- 5 Change the Font Size of an Element
Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this:
h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
} -->

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
</main>


<!-- 6 Set the Font Family of an Element
You can set which font an element should use, by using the font-family property.
For example, if you wanted to set your h2 element's font to sans-serif, you would use the following CSS:
h2 {
  font-family: sans-serif;
} -->

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
</main>


<!-- 7 Import a Google Font
In addition to specifying common fonts that are found on most operating systems, 
we can also specify non-standard, custom web fonts for use on our website. 
There are many sources for web fonts on the Internet. 
For this example we will focus on the Google Fonts library.

To import a Google Font, you can copy the font's URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your HTML. 
For this challenge, we'll import the Lobster font. 
To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor (before the opening style element):

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
Now you can use the Lobster font in your CSS by using Lobster as the FAMILY_NAME as in the following example:

font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;
The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available. 
This is covered in the next challenge.

Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. 
For example, you need quotes to use the "Open Sans" font, but not to use the Lobster font. -->

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
  h2 {    
    font-family: Lobster;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  ------
</main>


<!-- 8 Specify How Fonts Should Degrade
There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. 
These generic font families include monospace, serif and sans-serif.

When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.

For example, if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font, 
but degrade to the sans-serif font when Helvetica isn't available, you will specify it as follows:

p {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
Generic font family names are not case-sensitive. Also, they do not need quotes because they are CSS keywords.

To begin, apply the monospace font to the h2 element, so that it now has two fonts - Lobster and monospace.

In the last challenge, you imported the Lobster font using the link tag. 
Now comment out that import of the Lobster font (using the HTML comments you learned before) from Google Fonts so that it isn't available anymore.
Notice how your h2 element degrades to the monospace font.

Note: If you have the Lobster font installed on your computer, you won't see the degradation because your browser is able to find the font. -->

<!-- <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> -->
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  ------
</main>


<!-- 8 Size Your Images
CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.
For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called larger-image that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use:

<style>
  .larger-image {
    width: 500px;
  }
</style> -->

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img class="smaller-image" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>
</main>


<!-- 9 Add Borders Around Your Elements
CSS borders have properties like style, color and width.
For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:

<style>
  .thin-red-border {
    border-color: red;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style> 

Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element using its class attribute, by separating each class name with a space. For example:
<img class="class1 class2">
-->

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }

  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>
</main>


<!-- 10 Add Rounded Corners with border-radius
 We can round out those corners with a CSS property called border-radius. -->

.thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 10px;
  }


<!-- 11 Make Circular Images with a border-radius
In addition to pixels, you can also specify the border-radius using a percentage. -->

.thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 10px;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }


<!-- 12 Give a Background Color to a div Element
You can set an element's background color with the background-color property.
For example, if you wanted an element's background color to be green, you'd put this within your style element:

.green-background {
  background-color: green;
} -->

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style> 

  .silver-background {
    background-color: silver;
  }
  
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>

  <div class="silver-background">
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
  </div>
</main>
  

<!-- 13 Set the id of an Element
In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an id attribute.

There are several benefits to using id attributes: 
You can use an id to style a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript.

id attributes should be unique. 
Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice. 
So please don't give more than one element the same id attribute.

Here's an example of how you give your h2 element the id of cat-photo-app:
<h2 id="cat-photo-app"> -->
  
<form id="cat-photo-form" action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
