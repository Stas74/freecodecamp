<!-- 1 Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property
This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design. 
The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a number of core principles.

Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property.

text-align: justify; spaces the text so that each line has equal width.

text-align: center; centers the text

text-align: right; right-aligns the text

And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

Align the h4 tag's text, which says "Google", to the center. Then justify the paragraph tag which contains information about how Google was founded. -->

<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    margin-right: 20px;

  }
  .fullCard {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardLinks">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page" target="_blank" class="links">Larry Page</a>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin" target="_blank" class="links">Sergey Brin</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<!-- 2 Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property
You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS. 
Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units (such as px), 
or as a percentage of its containing parent element. 
Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:

img {
  width: 220px;
}

Add a width property to the entire card and set it to an absolute value of 245px. 
Use the fullCard class to select the element. -->

<style>  
  .fullCard {

    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
    width: 245px;
    
  }
</style>


<!-- 3 Adjust the Height of an Element Using the height Property
You can specify the height of an element using the height property in CSS, similar to the width property. 
Here's an example that changes the height of an image to 20px:

img {
  height: 20px;
}

Add a height property to the h4 tag and set it to 25px. -->

<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    height: 25px;

  }
</style>


<!-- 4 Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold
To make text bold, you can use the strong tag. 
This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. 
With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of font-weight: bold; to the element.

Wrap a strong tag around the text Stanford University inside the p tag (do not include the period). -->

<p>... were Ph.D. students at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</p>
