<!-- 1 Style the HTML Body Element
Now let's start fresh and talk about CSS inheritance.
Every HTML page has a body element.
We can prove that the body element exists here by giving it a background-color of black.
We can do this by adding the following to our style element:

body {
  background-color: black;
} -->

<style>  
  body {
    background-color: black;
  }
</style>


<!-- 2 Inherit Styles from the Body Element
Now we've proven that every HTML page has a body element, and that its body element can also be styled with CSS.
Remember, you can style your body element just like any other HTML element, and all your other elements will inherit your body element's styles.

First, create a h1 element with the text Hello World
Then, let's give all elements on your page the color of green by adding color: green; to your body element's style declaration.
Finally, give your body element the font-family of monospace by adding font-family: monospace; to your body element's style declaration. -->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: green;
    font-family: monospace;
  }

</style>

<h1>
  Hello World
</h1>


<!-- 3 Prioritize One Style Over Another
Sometimes your HTML elements will receive multiple styles that conflict with one another.
For example, your h1 element can't be both green and pink at the same time.
Let's see what happens when we create a class that makes text pink, then apply it to an element. 
Will our class override the body element's color: green; CSS property?

Create a CSS class called pink-text that gives an element the color pink.
Give your h1 element the class of pink-text. -->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }

  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text">Hello World!</h1>
