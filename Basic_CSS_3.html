<!-- 1 Style the HTML Body Element
Now let's start fresh and talk about CSS inheritance.
Every HTML page has a body element.
We can prove that the body element exists here by giving it a background-color of black.
We can do this by adding the following to our style element:

body {
  background-color: black;
} -->

<style>  
  body {
    background-color: black;
  }
</style>


<!-- 2 Inherit Styles from the Body Element
Now we've proven that every HTML page has a body element, and that its body element can also be styled with CSS.
Remember, you can style your body element just like any other HTML element, and all your other elements will inherit your body element's styles.

First, create a h1 element with the text Hello World
Then, let's give all elements on your page the color of green by adding color: green; to your body element's style declaration.
Finally, give your body element the font-family of monospace by adding font-family: monospace; to your body element's style declaration. -->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: green;
    font-family: monospace;
  }

</style>

<h1>
  Hello World
</h1>


<!-- 3 Prioritize One Style Over Another
Sometimes your HTML elements will receive multiple styles that conflict with one another.
For example, your h1 element can't be both green and pink at the same time.
Let's see what happens when we create a class that makes text pink, then apply it to an element. 
Will our class override the body element's color: green; CSS property?

Create a CSS class called pink-text that gives an element the color pink.
Give your h1 element the class of pink-text. -->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }

  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text">Hello World!</h1>


<!-- 4 Override Styles in Subsequent CSS
Our pink-text class overrode our body element's CSS declaration!
We just proved that our classes will override the body element's CSS. So the next logical question is, what can we do to override our pink-text class?

Create an additional CSS class called blue-text that gives an element the color blue. Make sure it's below your pink-text class declaration.
Apply the blue-text class to your h1 element in addition to your pink-text class, and let's see which one wins.
Applying multiple class attributes to a HTML element is done with a space between them like this:

class="class1 class2"
Note: It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.

However, the order of the class declarations in the <style> section is what is important. 
The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. 
Because .blue-text is declared second, it overrides the attributes of .pink-text. -->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>
