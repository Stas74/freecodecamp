<!-- 1 Change an Element's Relative Position
CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. 
Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) 
while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). 
The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.

When the position of an element is set to relative, 
it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. 
It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom. 
These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned. 
The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:

p {
  position: relative;
  bottom: 10px;
}
Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow - 
other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its default position.

Note: Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. 
It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, 
the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. 
This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content.

Change the position of the h2 to relative, and use a CSS offset to move it 15 pixels away from the top of where it sits in the normal flow. 
Notice there is no impact on the positions of the surrounding h1 and p elements. -->

<style>
  h2 {
    position: relative;
    top: 15px;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
  <h2>Move me!</h2>
  <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
</body>


<!-- 2 Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets
The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser 
how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. 
You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). 
As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.

Use CSS offsets to move the h2 15 pixels to the right and 10 pixels up. -->

<head>
<style>
  h2 {
    position: relative;
    left: 15px;
    bottom: 10px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
  <h2>Move me!</h2>
  <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
</body>


<!-- 3 Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning
The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. 
Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. 
The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.

One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor. 
If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), 
the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.

Lock the #searchbar element to the top-right of its section parent by declaring its position as absolute. Give it top and right offsets of 50 pixels each. -->

<style>
  #searchbar {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px;
    right: 50px;
  }
  section {
    position: relative;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <section>
    <form id="searchbar">
      <label for="search">Search:</label>
      <input type="search" id="search" name="search">
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Go!">
    </form>
  </section>
</body>


<!-- 4 Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning
The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the fixed position, which is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window. 
Similar to absolute positioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document. 
Other items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.

One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls.

The navigation bar in the code is labeled with an id of navbar. 
Change its position to fixed, and offset it 0 pixels from the top and 0 pixels from the left. 
After you have added the code, scroll the preview window to see how the navigation stays in place. -->

<style>
  body {
    min-height: 150vh;
  }
  #navbar {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0px;
    left: 0px;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #767676;
  }
  nav ul {
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 5px 0px 5px 30px;
  }
  nav li {
    display: inline;
    margin-right: 20px;
  }
  a {
    text-decoration: none;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <nav id="navbar">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <p>I shift up when the #navbar is fixed to the browser window.</p>
</body>
